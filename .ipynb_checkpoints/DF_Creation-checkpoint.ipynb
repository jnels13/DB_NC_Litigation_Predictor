COA07-391\\n Filed: 5 August 2008\\n Kidnapping–during robbery–insufficient evidence of separate offense\\n The evidence was not sufficient to support convictions for second-degree kidnapping\\n where defendant and others entered a McDonald’s, made the patrons and workers lie down, and\\n took the manager to the back to open the safe. The evidence establishes only the elements of\\n robbery with the one added component of the victims being required to lie down, which was a\\n mere technical asportation.\\n Appeal by defendant from judgments entered 14 July 1999 by\\n Judge Donald Jacobs in Durham County Superior Court. Heard in the\\n Court of Appeals 30 October 2007.\\n Attorney General Roy Cooper, by Assistant Attorney General\\n Charlie E. Reece, for the State.\\n Jarvis John Edgerton, IV for defendant-appellant.\\n GEER, Judge.\\n Defendant Mario Deandre Taylor appeals from his convictions of\\n one count of robbery with a dangerous weapon and 10 counts of\\n second degree kidnapping. Defendant primarily challenges the trial\\n court's denial of his motion to dismiss his second degree\\n kidnapping charges, arguing that the State failed to produce\\n sufficient evidence of confinement, restraint, or removal beyond\\n that which was inherent in the robbery with a dangerous weapon.\\n Because we agree with defendant that the State failed to meet its\\n burden, as required by State v. Fulcher, 294 N.C. 503, 243 S.E.2d\\n 338 (1978), and its progeny, of establishing an act of confinement,\\n -2-\\n restraint, or removal separate and apart from the robbery, we\\n vacate defendant's second degree kidnapping convictions.\\n Facts\\n The State's evidence tended to establish the following facts.\\n On the evening of 14 February 1998, defendant and another man\\n entered a McDonald's restaurant wearing masks. Defendant, who held\\n a 9mm pistol, ordered everyone to lie face down on the floor. When\\n a cashier remained standing, defendant pointed his gun at her and\\n again ordered her to lay down on the floor. Defendant and the\\n other man took the restaurant manager to the back of the restaurant\\n where the safe was located and ordered her to open it. A third\\n man, who had subsequently entered the restaurant, remained in the\\n lobby watching the customers and employees. The cashier, however,\\n ran out of the restaurant.\\n After defendant and the second man finished collecting the\\n cash from the safe, the three men ran out of the restaurant through\\n a side door. The cashier saw the men leave the restaurant and\\n identified defendant at trial as one of the perpetrators because he\\n had been wearing the same clothes a few days earlier when he came\\n into the restaurant to fill out an application.\\n Defendant was charged with one count of robbery with a\\n dangerous weapon and 13 counts of second degree kidnapping. During\\n the trial, the court dismissed two of the second degree kidnapping\\n charges. The court dismissed the count relating to the manager\\n because her asportation to the back of the restaurant to open the\\n safe was \"part and parcel\" of the robbery. With respect to the\\n -3-\\n second count, the court found that no evidence had been presented\\n at all as to that alleged victim.\\n The jury convicted defendant of robbery with a dangerous\\n weapon and 10 counts of second degree kidnapping; it acquitted him\\n of one count of second degree kidnapping. At sentencing, the trial\\n court made findings regarding aggravating and mitigating factors.\\n As an aggravating factor, the court found that defendant had joined\\n with more than one other person in committing the robbery with a\\n dangerous weapon and the kidnapping, but had not been indicted for\\n conspiracy. In mitigation, the court found that defendant had a\\n support system in the community and that he had voluntarily\\n cooperated with the police. The court concluded that the\\n aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating factors and,\\n therefore, imposed aggravated sentences of (1) 120 to 153 months\\n imprisonment for the robbery with a dangerous weapon conviction,\\n (2) 92 to 110 months for one of his kidnapping convictions (running\\n consecutively), (3) 92 to 110 months for a second kidnapping\\n conviction (running consecutively), and (4) 92 to 110 months for\\n the remaining eight kidnapping convictions (running concurrently\\n with the second kidnapping sentence). Each of defendant's\\n kidnapping sentences included a 60-month firearm enhancement\\n pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. § 15A-1340.16(A) (2007).\\n Defendant appealed in open court on 14 July 1999. While\\n defendant was granted appellate counsel, his appeal did not\\n progress for six years. We granted his petition for writ of\\n certiorari on 21 February 2006.\\n -4-\\n Discussion\\n Defendant's primary argument on appeal is that the trial court\\n erred in denying his motion to dismiss the second degree kidnapping\\n charges. Defendant maintains that the State presented insufficient\\n evidence of confinement, restraint, or removal separate from that\\n which was inherent in the robbery with a dangerous weapon and,\\n therefore, he cannot be convicted of both offenses under State v.\\n Fulcher, 294 N.C. 503, 523, 243 S.E.2d 338, 351 (1978).\\n In Fulcher, our Supreme Court stated:\\n It is self-evident that certain felonies\\n (e.g., forcible rape and armed robbery) cannot\\n be committed without some restraint of the\\n victim. We are of the opinion, and so hold,\\n that G.S. 14-39 was not intended by the\\n Legislature to make a restraint, which is an\\n inherent, inevitable feature of such other\\n felony, also kidnapping so as to permit the\\n conviction and punishment of the defendant for\\n both crimes. To hold otherwise would violate\\n the constitutional prohibition against double\\n jeopardy. Pursuant to the above mentioned\\n principle of statutory construction, we\\n construe the word \"restrain,\" as used in G.S.\\n 14-39, to connote a restraint separate and\\n apart from that which is inherent in the\\n commission of the other felony.\\n Id.\\n The Supreme Court further clarified the \"separate act\"\\n requirement in State v. Irwin, 304 N.C. 93, 103, 282 S.E.2d 439,\\n 446 (1981), holding that removal of an employee at knifepoint from\\n the front to the rear of a pharmacy to open the safe and obtain\\n drugs was \"an inherent and integral part of the attempted armed\\n robbery,\" and, therefore, the removal was legally insufficient to\\n -5-\\n convict the defendant of a separate charge of kidnapping. The\\n Court also noted that the defendant did not expose the victim \"to\\n greater danger than that inherent in the armed robbery itself, nor\\n [was the victim] subjected to the kind of danger and abuse the\\n kidnapping statute was designed to prevent.\" Id. As a result, the\\n Court concluded that the defendant's removal of the victim was \"a\\n mere technical asportation\" requiring dismissal of the kidnapping\\n charge. Id.\\n The Court more recently addressed this issue in State v.\\n Ripley, 360 N.C. 333, 626 S.E.2d 289 (2006). In Ripley, the Court\\n held:\\n [A] trial court, in determining whether a\\n defendant's asportation of a victim during the\\n commission of a separate felony offense\\n constitutes kidnapping, must consider whether\\n the asportation was an inherent part of the\\n separate felony offense, that is, whether the\\n movement was \"a mere technical asportation.\"\\n If the asportation is a separate act\\n independent of the originally committed\\n criminal act, a trial court must consider\\n additional factors such as whether the\\n asportation facilitated the defendant's\\n ability to commit a felony offense, or whether\\n the asportation exposed the victim to a\\n greater degree of danger than that which is\\n inherent in the concurrently committed felony\\n offense.\\n Id. at 340, 626 S.E.2d at 293-94.\\n Viewed in the light most favorable to the State, the evidence\\n in this case indicates that defendant entered the McDonald's\\n carrying a handgun, which he pointed at the customers and employees\\n as he ordered them to lie face down on the floor. Defendant and\\n another man found the manager and took her to the back of the\\n -6-\\n restaurant to open the safe while a third man stood guard over the\\n people on the floor.\\n The State contends that the robbery of the McDonald's occurred\\n at the safe located in the back office of the restaurant, and,\\n therefore, the restraint of the customers and employees in the\\n lobby was unnecessary to the commission of the robbery. We,\\n however, consider the present case to be controlled by State v.\\n Beatty, 347 N.C. 555, 495 S.E.2d 367 (1998), in which the Supreme\\n Court held that kidnapping charges, based on similar circumstances,\\n should have been dismissed.\\n In Beatty, a group of men approached the owner of a restaurant\\n outside an open door to the restaurant, put a gun to his head, and\\n told him to go inside and open the safe. Id. at 557, 495 S.E.2d at\\n 368. Once inside, the robbers saw two restaurant employees. One\\n employee, Poulos, \"was on his knees washing the floor at the\\n front,\" while the second, Koufaloitis, \"stood three to four feet\\n from the safe cleaning the floor in the back.\" Id., 495 S.E.2d at\\n 368-69. At that point, \"[o]ne robber put a gun to Poulos' head and\\n stood beside him during the robbery. An unarmed robber put duct\\n tape around Koufaloitis' wrists and told him to lie on the floor.\"\\n Id., 495 S.E.2d at 369.\\n The Supreme Court upheld the kidnapping conviction with\\n respect to Koufaloitis, but not as to Poulos. Id. at 560, 495\\n S.E.2d at 370. The Court explained that \"[w]hen defendant bound\\n [Koufaloitis'] wrists and kicked him in the back, he increased the\\n victim's helplessness and vulnerability beyond what was necessary\\n -7-\\n to enable him and his comrades to rob the restaurant.\" Id. at 559,\\n 495 S.E.2d at 370. On the other hand, \"[w]ith regard to victim\\n Poulos, the evidence shows only that one of the robbers approached\\n the victim, pointed a gun at him, and stood guarding him during the\\n robbery. The victim did not move during the robbery, and the\\n robbers did not injure him in any way.\" Id. at 560, 495 S.E.2d at\\n 370. The Court explained further: \"The only evidence of restraint\\n of this victim was the threatened use of a firearm. This restraint\\n is an essential element of robbery with a dangerous weapon under\\n N.C.G.S. § 14-87, and defendant's use of this restraint exposed the\\n victim to no greater danger than that required to complete the\\n robbery with a dangerous weapon.\" Id.\\n In this case, as in Beatty, the robbery took place at a safe\\n in the back of a restaurant, while the victims were restrained in\\n the front by another robber guarding them with a gun, without any\\n of the victims being bound or injured in any way. Because the\\n restaurant's occupants were not bound, once the robbery was\\n complete and the perpetrators had run out of the restaurant, the\\n occupants were not further restrained. Compare State v. Morgan,\\n 183 N.C. App. 160, 167, 645 S.E.2d 93, 99 (2007) (upholding\\n kidnapping conviction when \"[t]he evidence shows that the three\\n robbers bound the victims with duct tape, took money and cellular\\n telephones, and left the victims bound when they left the hotel\\n room\"), appeal dismissed and disc. review denied, 362 N.C. 241, 660\\n S.E.2d 536 (2008).\\n -8-\\n The sole distinction between this case and Beatty is that the\\n victims were required to lie down on the floor. In Ripley, 360\\n N.C. at 340, 626 S.E.2d at 294 (quoting Irwin, 304 N.C. at 103, 282\\n S.E.2d at 446), however, our Supreme Court concluded:\\n [T]he asportation of the [victims] from one\\n side of the motel lobby door to the other was\\n not legally sufficient to justify defendant's\\n convictions of second-degree kidnapping. The\\n moment defendant's accomplice drew his\\n firearm, the robbery with a dangerous weapon\\n had begun. The subsequent asportation of the\\n victims was \"a mere technical asportation\"\\n that was an inherent part of the robbery\\n defendant and his accomplices were engaged in.\\n We do not believe that defendant's order, at gunpoint, that the\\n victims lie down on the floor is materially different than the\\n Ripley robbers' order, also at gunpoint, that the victims move from\\n outside the door to the lobby to inside the door. Accordingly,\\n under Ripley, we hold that the act of requiring the victims to lie\\n down is a mere technical asportation insufficient to sustain a\\n charge of kidnapping separate from the robbery.\\n This conclusion is supported by this Court's decision in State\\n v. Ross, 133 N.C. App. 310, 515 S.E.2d 252 (1999). In Ross, the\\n record indicated \"that, upon entering the apartment, [a robber]\\n pointed the shotgun at [the two victims] and ordered them to step\\n away from the apartment door and get on the floor.\" Id. at 313,\\n 515 S.E.2d at 254. Although one of the victims backed from the\\n living room into the kitchen before lying down, the Court held that\\n the evidence was insufficient to establish a removal separate from\\n the robbery when the robbers did not order the victim to move to\\n the kitchen, but rather only ordered him to \"back up and get on the\\n -9-\\n floor.\" Id. The evidence of restraint or removal was no greater\\n in this case.\\n The State, however, points to State v. Brice, 126 N.C. App.\\n 788, 486 S.E.2d 719 (1997), a decision rendered a year before\\n Beatty. In Brice, one defendant was in the bedroom robbing two\\n male victims, while a second robber was outside the house demanding\\n money from another male victim. A third robber was in the living\\n room with the female victim. The third robber threatened the woman\\n with a gun and ordered her to lie face down on the floor, causing\\n her to become ill. Id. at 790, 486 S.E.2d at 720. This Court\\n explained in Ross that \"[i]n Brice, our Court held that terrorizing\\n the woman in the living room was not an inherent part of the\\n robbery taking place in the bedroom.\" Ross, 133 N.C. App. at 314,\\n 515 S.E.2d at 255. As the Court acknowledged in Brice, this\\n terrorization was not necessary to carry out the robbery of either\\n the victims in the bedroom or the victim outside the house. Brice,\\n 126 N.C. App. at 791, 486 S.E.2d at 720. We believe, however, that\\n this case more closely resembles Beatty and Ross.\\n State v. Davidson, 77 N.C. App. 540, 335 S.E.2d 518 (1985),\\n disc. review denied, 315 N.C. 393, 338 S.E.2d 882 (1986), also\\n relied upon by the State, is likewise inapposite. In Davidson, the\\n defendants entered a retail store, and, at gunpoint, took the\\n store's occupants from the front of the store to a dressing room in\\n the rear of the store; bound their heads, arms, and legs; took\\n their valuables; and then took cash and merchandise from the store.\\n Id. at 541, 335 S.E.2d at 519. In upholding the kidnapping\\n -10-\\n convictions, this Court concluded: \"Removal of the victims to the\\n dressing room [where none of the stolen property was kept] thus was\\n not an inherent and integral part of the robbery.\" Id. at 543, 335\\n S.E.2d at 520. The \"removal\" was the critical factor.\\n The State, however, points to this Court's statement in\\n Davidson that the removal \"was a separate course of conduct\\n designed to remove the victims from the view of passersby who might\\n have hindered the commission of the crime.\" Id. The State\\n contends that the conduct in this case necessarily must have been\\n for the same purpose. In making this argument, the State overlooks\\n the fact that there must still have been \"a separate course of\\n conduct.\" Id.\\n In this case, in contrast to Davidson, no removal occurred.\\n The only conduct presented by the State as being apart from the\\n robbery was the guarding of victims with a gun while face down on\\n the floor. While the removal of the victims was not necessary to\\n the robbery in Davidson, both the use of the firearm and the\\n presence of the individual victims were necessary to the robbery\\n with a dangerous weapon conviction. Under N.C. Gen. Stat. § 14-\\n 87(a) (2007), a person is guilty of robbery with a dangerous weapon\\n if that person, \"having in possession or with the use or threatened\\n use of any firearms or other dangerous weapon, implement or means,\\n whereby the life of a person is endangered or threatened,\\n unlawfully takes or attempts to take personal property from another\\n or from any place of business, residence or banking institution or\\n any other place where there is a person or persons in attendance .\\n -11-\\n . . .\" (Emphasis added.) Consistent with the statute, the State's\\n indictments in this case alleged the threatened use of firearms and\\n the taking of McDonald's property while the alleged kidnapping\\n victims were present.\\n In sum, the State's evidence of kidnapping established only\\n the elements of the crime of robbery with a dangerous weapon with\\n the lone added component of the victims' being required to lie down\\n on the floor. Under Ripley, that lone act is a mere technical\\n asportation. As a result, unlike Davidson, the State presented no\\n additional evidence of restraint, confinement, or removal beyond\\n that necessary to commit the robbery.\\n We, therefore, hold that the evidence in the record is\\n insufficient to support defendant's convictions for second degree\\n kidnapping under Fulcher, and the trial court should have granted\\n defendant's motion to dismiss those charges. Because we are\\n vacating defendant's second degree kidnapping convictions, we do\\n not address defendant's additional arguments relating to those\\n convictions. Defendant does not make any arguments on appeal\\n regarding his robbery with a dangerous weapon conviction and thus,\\n as to that conviction, we find no error.\\n Vacated in part; no error in part.\\n Judges WYNN and STEELMAN concur.\"\"\"\n",

Return of all\\n such receipts shall be made to the retirement\\n system, if possible, after determination that\\n such funds are not necessary to address the\\n deficit.\\n In compliance with Executive Order No. 3, Edward Renfrow, the State\\n Controller at the time, issued a memorandum on 15 February 2001 to\\n all chief fiscal officers, vice chancellors, business managers, and\\n local education authorities affiliated with employers participating\\n in State-funded retirement systems. Specifically, he directed that\\n all such employers send the funds allocated as employer\\n contributions for the Teachers' and State Employees' Retirement\\n System of North Carolina (the Retirement System) to an escrow\\n account (the escrow account) in the Office of the State Controller.\\n Between February and June 2001, State employers sent\\n $208,362,861.00 of Retirement System employer contributions to the\\n escrow account. The Governor extended the terms of Executive Order\\n No. 3 to include employer contributions for July and August 2001,\\n and State employers sent an additional $16,511,854.00 of Retirement\\n System employer contributions to the escrow account during that\\n period of time.

The two other retirement systems were the Legislative\\n Retirement System and the Judicial Retirement System. As of 31\\n December 2001, a total of $129,924,859.00 of Retirement System\\n employer contributions that had been sent to the escrow account had\\n not been repaid to the Retirement System.\\n Plaintiffs initiated this action on 14 June 2002 by filing a\\n complaint for declaratory judgment and a petition for writ of\\n mandamus. Plaintiffs alleged that the State of North Carolina; the\\n Governor; Robert Powell, in his capacity as State Controller of\\n North Carolina; and David T. McCoy, in his capacity as State Budget\\n Officer of North Carolina, violated the Contract Clause of the\\n United States Constitution; Article V, section 6(2) of the North\\n Carolina Constitution; and Article I, sections 1 and 19 of the\\n North Carolina Constitution. Plaintiffs also sought a writ of\\n mandamus to require the Governor, Robert Powell, and David T. McCoy\\n to permanently desist from the seizure and diversion of employer\\n contributions, and to return to the Retirement System all funds\\n that were appropriated, paid, seized, and diverted. Plaintiffs\\n further sought a writ of mandamus to compel Richard H. Moore, in\\n his capacity as Treasurer of North Carolina (the Treasurer), and\\n the Board of Trustees (the Board) of the Retirement System to\\n comply with N.C. Gen. Stat. § 135-8(f)(3).\\n Defendants filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' complaint on\\n 19 August 2002. Pursuant to Rule 2.1(a) of the General Rules of\\n -5-\\n Practice, the Chief Justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court\\n designated the case as exceptional and assigned the case to\\n Emergency Judge Joseph R. John, Sr. Plaintiffs filed a first\\n amended complaint for declaratory judgment, petition for writ of\\n mandamus, and motion for class certification dated 12 February\\n 2004.\\n The trial court entered an order certifying a class on 27\\n February 2004, and defined the class as follows: \"[A]ll North\\n Carolina teachers and State employees who were members of the\\n Teachers' and State Employees' Retirement System of North Carolina,\\n as provided in [N.C.

Defendants filed an answer, dated 27\\n April 2004, to the first amended complaint.\\n Following substantial discovery, Plaintiffs and Defendants\\n filed cross-motions for summary judgment on 20 February 2006.\\n Plaintiffs subsequently filed a motion to amend their first amended\\n complaint, seeking to add a paragraph and amend an existing\\n paragraph to add a claim under Article I, section 6 of the North\\n Carolina Constitution. In their motion, Plaintiffs stated that\\n Defendants did not object to Plaintiffs' motion to amend. The\\n trial court entered an order on 26 July 2006 amending both\\n Plaintiffs' first amended complaint and Defendants' answer to\\n Plaintiffs' first amended complaint.\\n The trial court entered an order on the cross-motions for\\n -6-\\n summary judgment on 6 September 2006, granting summary judgment for\\n Plaintiffs on their \"claim for declaratory judgment establishing\\n that the actions of [D]efendants State of North Carolina, the\\n Governor of North Carolina, the State Controller of North Carolina,\\n and the State Budget Officer of North Carolina violate[d] Article\\n V, Section 6 of the North Carolina Constitution[.]\" Regarding\\n Plaintiffs' claim for declaratory judgment that the actions of\\n these Defendants violated the Contract Clause of the United States\\n Constitution, the trial court ordered the following:\\n [T]he Court will reserve ruling to allow the\\n parties to determine whether sufficient\\n stipulated facts can be provided to the Court\\n to allow for ruling without a trial. Counsel\\n are directed to report to the Court, within 15\\n days of the entry of this order, as to whether\\n an additional hearing on this issue is\\n necessary, and whether at such hearing the\\n parties will put on evidence or submit\\n stipulated facts.\\n The trial court also entered summary judgment for Defendants on\\n Plaintiffs' remaining claims for declaratory judgment and on\\n Plaintiffs' two remaining claims for writ of mandamus, one of which\\n is the subject of Plaintiffs' appeal.\\n The parties filed a joint statement of stipulations regarding\\n Plaintiffs' Contract Clause claim on 18 October 2006, and the trial\\n court entered a final order on substantive claims on 27 February\\n 2007. The trial court ordered: \"The 6 September 2006 order is\\n incorporated by reference in its entirety, such that the present\\n order shall serve as the final judgment of the trial court in this\\n case with regard to the substantive claims raised in the\\n complaint[.]\" The trial court also stated:\\n -7-\\n 3.

The\\n Plaintiff Class likewise has met its burden of\\n proving that the State's actions impaired the\\n contract.\\n 4. With regard to the third prong,\\n [D]efendants have met their burden of proving\\n that the Governor's maintaining compliance\\n with his constitutional responsibility to\\n ensure a balanced budget constitutes an\\n important public purpose. However,\\n [D]efendants have failed to carry their burden\\n of proving that the diversion of employer\\n contributions was \"reasonable\" or \"necessary\"\\n in service of that purpose. In so ruling, the\\n Court observes that the provisions for the\\n 'inviolability' of retirement system funds\\n contained in the Constitution of North\\n Carolina indicate a public policy that would\\n favor protection of these funds under the\\n circumstances of the present case.\\n The trial court granted summary judgment for Plaintiffs on their\\n Contract Clause claim. The trial court also certified the matter\\n for immediate appeal:\\n Further, the Court finds that the instant case\\n involves multiple parties and multiple claims,\\n that the Court has entered final judgment as\\n to certain claims and certain parties, that\\n the Court has entered final judgment as to all\\n substantive claims raised in the complaint,\\n and that there is no just reason for delay of\\n the parties' respective appeals; therefore,\\n pursuant to N.C.G.S.

V, § 6(2) provides:\\n Neither the General Assembly nor any public\\n officer, employee, or agency shall use or\\n authorize to be used any part of the funds of\\n the Teachers' and State Employees' Retirement\\n System or the Local Governmental Employees'\\n -9-\\n Retirement System for any purpose other than\\n retirement system benefits and purposes,\\n administrative expenses, and refunds; except\\n that retirement system funds may be invested\\n as authorized by law, subject to the\\n investment limitation that the funds of the\\n Teachers' and State Employees' Retirement\\n System and the Local Governmental Employees'\\n Retirement System shall not be applied,\\n diverted, loaned to, or used by the State, any\\n State agency, State officer, public officer,\\n or public employee.\\n Defendants argue that the protections of Article V, section\\n 6(2) of the North Carolina Constitution do not apply to their\\n actions because the employer contributions at issue in the present\\n case were not yet part of the funds of the Retirement System.\\n Specifically, Defendants argue that\\n no monies appropriated by the General Assembly\\n for salaries and related expenses of employees\\n are considered employer contributions to the\\n Retirement System unless and until they are\\n actually remitted to and received by the\\n Retirement System, and only then are they\\n placed in a Retirement System fund subject to\\n the protections of Article V, § 6.\\n Plaintiffs counter that a violation of Article V, section 6(2) of\\n the North Carolina Constitution occurs where \"monies identified as\\n employer contributions, and paid in the exact amounts and on the\\n exact schedule required for employer contributions by the\\n [Retirement] System, are diverted to another use before being\\n deposited into the [Retirement] System[.]\" Plaintiffs specifically\\n focus on the language in Article V, section 6(2) that states that\\n Retirement System funds shall not be \"diverted.\"\\n We thus determine whether Defendants' actions \"diverted\"\\n Retirement System funds in violation of Article V, section 6(2) of\\n -10-\\n the North Carolina Constitution. \"Issues concerning the proper\\n construction of the Constitution of North Carolina 'are in the main\\n governed by the same general principles which control in\\n ascertaining the meaning of all written instruments.'\" State ex\\n rel. Martin v. Preston, 325 N.C. 438, 449, 385 S.E.2d 473, 478\\n (1989) (quoting Perry v. Stancil, 237 N.C. 442, 444, 75 S.E.2d 512,\\n 514 (1953)). \"In interpreting our Constitution — as in\\n interpreting a statute — where the meaning is clear from the words\\n used, we will not search for a meaning elsewhere.\" Id. at 449, 385\\n S.E.2d at 479.\\n The term \"divert\" is defined as follows: \"To turn aside from\\n a direction or course[.]\" Webster's II New College Dictionary 339\\n (3d ed. 2005). In the present case, the funds at issue were\\n intended for the Retirement System. However, in compliance with\\n Executive Order No. 3, the State Controller ordered those funds to\\n be deposited in the escrow account. State employers did as\\n directed and, as the trial court found, the funds were used\\n entirely \"for purposes other than retirement system benefits and\\n purposes, administrative expenses, and refunds.\" By these actions,\\n Defendants turned the funds aside from their intended destination,\\n which was the Retirement System.\\n Defendants argue that \"the use of the word 'diverted' is\\n consistent with the Constitution's protection against misuse of the\\n funds which are in the possession of and controlled by the\\n Treasurer.\" Therefore, Defendants argue, the North Carolina\\n Constitution does not protect employer contributions not yet\\n -11-\\n deposited in Retirement System accounts. However, Article V,\\n section 6(2) of the North Carolina Constitution not only precludes\\n retirement system funds from being \"applied,\" \"loaned to,\" or \"used\\n by\" the State, but also precludes those funds from being \"diverted\"\\n by the State. Even if the terms other than \"diverted\" apply only\\n in the context of funds already held in Retirement System accounts,\\n which we do not decide, \"we follow the maxims of statutory\\n construction that words of a statute are not to be deemed useless\\n or redundant[.]\" Town of Pine Knoll Shores v. Evans, 331 N.C. 361,\\n 366, 416 S.E.2d 4, 7 (1992) (emphasis added). Therefore, we must\\n give effect to the term \"diverted.\" See Preston, 325 N.C. at 449,\\n 385 S.E.2d at 478 (stating: \"'The will of the people as expressed\\n in the Constitution is the supreme law of the land. In searching\\n for this will or intent all cognate provisions are to be brought\\n into view in their entirety and so interpreted as to effectuate the\\n manifest purposes of the instrument. The best way to ascertain the\\n meaning of a word or sentence in the Constitution is to read it\\n contextually and to compare it with other words and sentences with\\n which it stands connected.'\" (quoting State v. Emery, 224 N.C. 581,\\n 583, 31 S.E.2d 858, 860 (1944) (citations omitted))). Applying the\\n plain meaning of the term \"diverted,\" we hold that the prohibition\\n against seizure of the Retirement System's funds applies to, and\\n includes, those funds appropriated and intended for the Retirement\\n System, but not yet deposited therein. We thus hold that\\n Defendants diverted assets of the Retirement System and, by doing\\n so, Defendants violated Article V, section 6(2) of the North\\n -12-\\n Carolina Constitution. Therefore, we hold the trial court did not\\n err by granting Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment.\\n II.\\n These Defendants also argue the trial court erred by granting\\n summary judgment for Plaintiffs on the ground that Executive Order\\n No. 3 violated the Contract Clause of the United States\\n Constitution. The Contract Clause of the United States\\n Constitution provides that \"[n]o state shall . . . pass\\n any . . . law impairing the obligation of contracts[.]\" U.S.\\n Const. art. I, § 10. In order to determine whether there has been\\n a violation of the Contract Clause, a court must ascertain the\\n following: \"(1) whether a contractual obligation is present, (2)\\n whether the state's actions impaired that contract, and (3) whether\\n the impairment was reasonable and necessary to serve an important\\n public purpose.\" Bailey v. State of North Carolina, 348 N.C. 130,\\n 140-41, 500 S.E.2d 54, 60 (1998). We address these requirements in\\n the following three subsections.\\n A.\\n [2] It is well settled, and Defendants do not contest, that a\\n contractual relationship exists between vested State employees and\\n the State's retirement systems, and that vested State employees\\n have contractual rights to their retirement benefits. See id. at\\n 150, 500 S.E.2d at 66 (holding that \"the relationship between the\\n Retirement Systems and employees vested in the system is\\n contractual in nature, [and] the right to benefits exempt from\\n state taxation is a term of such contract\"); Faulkenbury v.\\n -13-\\n Teachers' and State Employees' Ret. Sys., 345 N.C. 683, 690, 483\\n S.E.2d 422, 427 (1997) (recognizing that vested state employees\\n have contractual rights to disability benefits calculated pursuant\\n to the method in place when they vested); Simpson v. N.C. Local\\n Gov't Employees' Retirement System, 88 N.C. App. 218, 224, 363\\n S.E.2d 90, 94 (1987), aff'd per curiam, 323 N.C. 362, 372 S.E.2d\\n 559 (1988) (holding that \"members of the North Carolina Local\\n Governmental Employees' Retirement System[] ha[ve] a contractual\\n right to rely on the terms of the retirement plan as these terms\\n existed at the moment their retirement rights became vested\").\\n Defendants argue, however, that Plaintiffs do not have a\\n contractual right to a retirement system that is funded in an\\n actuarially sound manner, as concluded by the trial court.\\n Defendants also argue that \"[P]laintiffs have neither alleged nor\\n shown that they are not receiving the benefits to which they are\\n entitled, nor can they show that their benefits have in any way\\n been harmed or are in danger of being harmed by action taken\\n pursuant to Executive Order No. 3.\"\\n In Bailey, our Supreme Court recognized that the determination\\n that a contractual relationship exists does not end the inquiry;\\n \"[t]his Court must determine whether the tax exemption was a\\n condition or term included in the retirement contract.\" Bailey,\\n 348 N.C. at 146, 500 S.E.2d at 63; see also Robertson v.\\n Kulongoski, 466 F.3d 1114, 1117 (9th Cir. 2006), cert. denied, 550\\n U.S. ___, 167 L. Ed. 2d 1092 (2007) (stating that \"'[t]he first\\n sub-inquiry is not whether any contractual relationship whatsoever\\n -14-\\n exists between the parties, but whether there was a \"contractual\\n agreement regarding the specific . . . terms allegedly at issue\"'\"\\n (citations omitted)). In Bailey, our Supreme Court held that the\\n trial court's finding that the plaintiffs had a contractual right\\n to the tax exemption at issue was supported by evidence of\\n creation of various statutory tax exemptions\\n by the legislature, the location of those\\n provisions alongside the other statutorily\\n created benefit terms instead of within the\\n general income tax code, the frequency of\\n governmental contract making, communication of\\n the exemption by governmental agents in both\\n written and oral form, use of the exemption as\\n inducement for employment, mandatory\\n participation, reduction of periodic wages by\\n contribution amount (evidencing compensation),\\n loss of interest for those not vesting,\\n establishment of a set time period for\\n vesting, and the reliance of employees upon\\n retirement compensation in exchange for their\\n services. Thus, it is clear the tax exemption\\n was a term or condition of benefits of the\\n Retirement Systems to which [the] plaintiffs\\n have a contractual right.\\n Bailey, 348 N.C. at 146, 500 S.E.2d at 63.\\n In the present case, our Court must determine whether, as a\\n term of their contracts for retirement benefits, Plaintiffs were\\n entitled to have the Retirement System funded in an actuarially\\n sound manner. An \"actuarially sound retirement system\" is defined\\n as a \"retirement plan that contains sufficient funds to pay future\\n obligations, as by receiving contributions from employees and the\\n employer to be invested in accounts to pay future benefits.\"\\n Black's Law Dictionary 39 (8th ed. 2004).\\n We first examine the statutes in effect at the time of the\\n diversion of the employer contributions. See Wells v. Consolidated\\n -15-\\n Jud'l Ret. Sys. of N.C., 136 N.C. App. 671, 673, 526 S.E.2d 486,\\n 488-89 (2000), aff'd, 354 N.C. 313, 553 S.E.2d 877, reh'g denied,\\n 354 N.C. 580, 559 S.E.2d 553 (2001) (stating that \"[t]he\\n [retirement] contract is embodied in state statute and governed by\\n statutory provisions as they existed at the time the employee's\\n contractual rights vested\"). Specifically, we consider N.C. Gen.\\n Stat. § 135-8(d)(1), which deals with the method of financing the\\n Retirement System, and which provides as follows:\\n On account of each member there shall be paid\\n in the pension accumulation fund by employers\\n an amount equal to a certain percentage of the\\n actual compensation of each member to be known\\n as the \"normal contribution,\" and an\\n additional amount equal to a percentage of his\\n actual compensation to be known as the\\n \"accrued liability contribution.\" The rate\\n per centum of such contributions shall be\\n fixed on the basis of the liabilities of the\\n Retirement System as shown by actuarial\\n valuation.\\n N.C. Gen. Stat. § 135-8(d)(1) (2001) (emphasis added). An\\n actuarial valuation is determined by an actuary, who is a\\n \"statistician who determines the present effects of future\\n contingent events; esp., one who calculates insurance and pension\\n rates on the basis of empirically based tables.\" Black's Law\\n Dictionary 39 (8th ed. 2004). N.C. Gen. Stat. § 135-8(d)(3) (2001)\\n provides, in pertinent part: \"Upon certification by the actuary\\n engaged by the Board of Trustees that the accrued liability\\n contribution rate may be reduced without impairing the Retirement\\n System, the Board of Trustees may cause the accrued liability\\n contribution rate to be reduced.\" This statute demonstrates that\\n contributions to the Retirement System can be reduced only if the\\n -16-\\n State's actuary certifies that such a reduction will not impair the\\n Retirement System. However, as we discuss in subsection B below,\\n the State's actuary in the present case did not make such a\\n certification.\\n We next consider N.C. Gen. Stat. § 135-6 (2001), which governs\\n the administration of the Retirement System. N.C. Gen. Stat. §\\n 135-6(g) (2001) requires the Board of Trustees to \"engage such\\n actuarial and other service as shall be required to transact the\\n business of the Retirement System.\" N.C. Gen. Stat. § 135-6(h)\\n (2001) also requires the following: \"The Board of Trustees shall\\n keep in convenient form such data as shall be necessary for\\n actuarial valuation of the various funds of the Retirement System,\\n and for checking the experience of the System.\" N.C. Gen. Stat. §\\n 135-6(i) (2001) provides:\\n The Board of Trustees shall keep a record of\\n all of its proceedings which shall be open to\\n public inspection. It shall publish annually\\n a report showing the fiscal transactions of\\n the Retirement System for the preceding year,\\n the amount of the accumulated cash and\\n securities of the System, and the last balance\\n sheet showing the financial condition of the\\n System by means of an actuarial valuation of\\n the assets and liabilities of the Retirement\\n System.\\n The following statutes, N.C. Gen. Stat. § 135-6(m)-(o) (2001), all\\n envision an active role for an actuary in the Retirement System:\\n (m) Immediately after the establishment of the\\n Retirement System the actuary shall make such\\n investigation of the mortality, service and\\n compensation experience of the members of the\\n System as he shall recommend and the Board of\\n Trustees shall authorize, and on the basis of\\n such investigation he shall recommend for\\n adoption by the Board of Trustees such tables\\n -17-\\n and such rates as are required in subsection\\n (n), subdivisions (1) and (2), of this\\n section. The Board of Trustees shall adopt\\n tables and certify rates, and as soon as\\n practicable thereafter the actuary shall make\\n a valuation based on such tables and rates of\\n the assets and liabilities of the funds\\n created by this Chapter.\\n (n) In 1943, and at least once in each\\n five-year period thereafter, the actuary shall\\n make an actuarial investigation into the\\n mortality, service and compensation experience\\n of the members and beneficiaries of the\\n Retirement System, and shall make a valuation\\n of the assets and liabilities of the funds of\\n the System, and taking into account the result\\n of such investigation and valuation, the Board\\n of Trustees shall:\\n (1) Adopt for the Retirement System such\\n mortality, service and other tables as\\n shall be deemed necessary; and\\n (2) Certify the rates of contributions\\n payable by the State of North Carolina on\\n account of new entrants at various ages.\\n (o) On the basis of such tables and interest\\n assumption rate as the Board of Trustees shall\\n adopt, the actuary shall make an annual\\n valuation of the assets and liabilities of the\\n funds of the System created by this Chapter.\\n Upon review of these statutes, it is clear that Plaintiffs had\\n a contractual right to the funding of the Retirement System in an\\n actuarially sound manner. Therefore, we hold that the right to\\n have the Retirement System funded in an actuarially sound manner is\\n a term or condition included in Plaintiffs' retirement contracts.\\n See Bailey, 348 N.C. at 146, 500 S.E.2d at 63 (holding that \"the\\n tax exemption was a term or condition of benefits of the Retirement\\n Systems to which [the] plaintiffs have a contractual right\").\\n Moreover, the record in this case, on which the trial court\\n -18-\\n relied in granting summary judgment for Plaintiffs, contains\\n several examples of representations made to Plaintiffs that\\n demonstrate that Plaintiffs have a contractual right to have the\\n Retirement System funded in an actuarially sound manner. A\\n pamphlet in the record entitled, \"1975 YOUR RETIREMENT SYSTEM - how\\n it works,\" which was distributed to State employees, stated the\\n following:\\n YOUR EMPLOYER'S CONTRIBUTIONS\\n Your employer contributes the major part\\n of the cost of the benefits.\\n Your employer is currently contributing\\n at the rate of 9.12% of all salaries\\n subject to retirement deductions.\\n Your employer contributes to your\\n retirement until you retire, regardless\\n of age. The contributions are based on\\n actuarial calculations so that your\\n benefits can be provided on a sound\\n basis.\\n Similarly, a 1 July 1996 pamphlet in the record entitled, \"Your\\n Retirement Benefits\" stated the following: \"The State bases\\n contributions on the calculations prepared by an actuary.\" The\\n pamphlet further stated the following:\\n Funded Status\\n The Retirement System has been labeled as\\n \"actuarially sound\" because of the consistent\\n use over the years of:\\n [--] actuarial assumptions based on\\n experience,\\n [--] an approved actuarial funding method, and\\n [--] the recognition of all promised benefits\\n in the actuarial liabilities.\\n -19-\\n Our decision is further supported by numerous decisions of\\n courts in other jurisdictions, which have held that vested state\\n employees have a contractual right to have their retirement systems\\n funded in an actuarially sound manner. See Municipality of\\n Anchorage v. Gallion, 944 P.2d 436 (Alaska 1997); Dadisman v.\\n Moore, 384 S.E.2d 816 (W. Va. 1989); Valdes v. Cory, 189 Cal. Rptr.\\n 212 (Cal. Ct. App. 1983); Sgaglione v. Levitt, 337 N.E.2d 592 (N.Y.\\n 1975); Weaver v. Evans, 495 P.2d 639 (Wash. 1972); Dombrowski v.\\n City of Philadelphia, 245 A.2d 238 (Pa. 1968); State Teachers'\\n Retirement Board v. Giessel, 106 N.W.2d 301 (Wis. 1960).\\n B.\\n [3] These Defendants next argue that \"even if a contractual\\n right to an actuarially sound retirement system exists, there is no\\n impairment of that contractual right if there is no impairment or\\n diminishment of accrued, vested benefits.\" In support of their\\n argument, Defendants rely upon RPEC v. Charles, 62 P.3d 470 (Wash.\\n 2003), and Halstead v. City of Flint, 338 N.W.2d 903 (Mich. Ct.\\n App. 1983). However, these cases are distinguishable.\\n In RPEC, the Washington Supreme Court held, as we do in the\\n present case, that retirees and State employees did \"have vested\\n contractual rights to the systematic funding of the retirement\\n system to maintain actuarial soundness.\" RPEC, 62 P.3d at 483.\\n However, the Court also held that \"there is no indication that the\\n lowered [employer] contribution rates render the system actuarially\\n unsound.\" Id. at 484. Consequently, the Court held that the\\n \"appellants have not met their burden of proof that a question of\\n -20-\\n fact exists as to whether the system is actuarially unsound, i.e.,\\n the modifications made in EHB 2487 have not been shown to affect\\n Retirees' and Employees' vested pension right.\" Id. Importantly,\\n however, the State Actuary in RPEC had determined that the lowered\\n employer contribution rates would not render the system actuarially\\n unsound: \"The stated reason for reducing the rates was that the\\n 1998 valuation from the State Actuary determined that the funding\\n goals expressed in former RCW 41.45.010 (1998) could still be met\\n using lower contribution rates, primarily because of investment\\n returns on the pension funds that were higher than anticipated.\"\\n Id. at 476.\\n In contrast to RPEC, the record shows the State's actuary in\\n the case before us, Edward A. Macdonald (Mr. Macdonald), stated the\\n following in a 6 February 2001 letter to the Deputy Treasurer and\\n Director of the Retirement Systems Division of the State Treasurer:\\n \"The employer rate cannot be reduced effective February 1, 2001 in\\n an actuarially sound manner. . . . The System is not being funded\\n in an actuarial[ly] sound manner since the actual contributions\\n will be less than the annual required contributions.\" Mr.\\n Macdonald also testified at a deposition as follows:\\n Q And have you since learning about the case\\n formed any opinions concerning issues that\\n have been raised in this lawsuit?\\n A I had opinions prior to the lawsuit being\\n filed.\\n Q Can you tell me generally what those\\n opinions are?\\n A That the escrowing of the money was not\\n actuarially sound for the system. I believe I\\n -21-\\n wrote at least one letter regarding that back\\n probably three or four, probably three years\\n ago.\\n Q Do you have any other opinions concerning\\n the escrow of the money?\\n A That eventually it ought to be repaid. I\\n mean, you know --\\n Q Will its having been repaid, assuming that\\n happens, will its having been repaid change\\n your opinion about whether the action in\\n escrowing the money was actuarial[ly] sound?\\n A That action is actuarially unsound at that\\n time, and repaying the money doesn't really\\n change that.\\n Defendants, however, point to Mr. Macdonald's deposition\\n testimony that his opinion regarding the actuarially unsound manner\\n of funding the Retirement System \"does not mean the system is\\n actuarially unsound. It just means during that fiscal year the\\n contribution that was made was not satisfactory of the fund, which\\n should have been funded.\" Mr. Macdonald also testified that\\n \"maintaining an operating System in an actuarially unsound manner\\n does not necessarily render the entire System actuarially\\n unsound[.]\"\\n The courts of other states have previously rejected arguments\\n similar to the argument of Defendants. In Dadisman, the West\\n Virginia Supreme Court cited Valdes, Weaver, and Dombrowski for the\\n following proposition:\\n Those cases found that even where a unilateral\\n reduction in the state's share of pension\\n contributions, as earned by State employees,\\n does not result in out-of-pocket losses for\\n plan participants, they still have a vested\\n interest in the integrity and security of the\\n funds available to pay future benefits. See,\\n -22-\\n e.g., Valdes, 139 Cal. App. 3d at 785, 189\\n Cal. Rptr. 222. We agree with this reasoning.\\n Dadisman, 384 S.E.2d at 828. We also find this reasoning\\n compelling. At the point in time when the employer contributions\\n were escrowed in this case, the Retirement System was not being\\n funded in an actuarially sound manner. At that time, it was\\n unclear when, or even whether, the diverted funds would be repaid.\\n Accordingly, the actuarially unsound diversion of funds threatened\\n the integrity and security of the Retirement System. Therefore, we\\n hold that by diverting the funds, Defendants' actions impaired the\\n contractual right of Plaintiffs to a retirement system funded in an\\n actuarially sound manner. See Bailey, 348 N.C. at 150-51, 500\\n S.E.2d at 66; see also Public Employee Pensions in Times of Fiscal\\n Distress, 90 Harv. L. Rev. 992, 1006 (March 1977) (stating that\\n \"[o]n several occasions, governments have failed to continue the\\n actuarial appropriations they had promised to make to the pension\\n system, and courts have uniformly held these missed appropriations\\n to be contract violations\").\\n Defendants also rely upon Halstead, in which the Michigan\\n Court of Appeals cited the Michigan State Constitution, which\\n provided that \"accrued financial benefits of the state's or a\\n political subdivision's pension plan are a contractual obligation\\n which cannot be diminished or impaired.\" Halstead, 338 N.W.2d at\\n 905-06. The Michigan Court of Appeals also recognized that\\n \"'[a]ccrued financial benefits' have been defined as the right to\\n receive certain pension payments upon retirement based on service\\n performed.\" Id. at 906. However, the Court went further in\\n -23-\\n holding that \"[b]ecause there is no evidence that ordinance § 35-\\n 16.3 diminishes or impairs the full payment of [the] plaintiffs'\\n accrued financial benefits, the ordinance does not violate the\\n constitutional proscription against impairment of contracts.\" Id.\\n Halstead is readily distinguishable from the present case because\\n it presented the narrow issue of whether the legislative enactment\\n violated the constitutional proscription against diminishing\\n accrued financial benefits. In contrast, the issue in the case\\n before us is whether Defendants' actions violated Plaintiffs'\\n contractual right to a retirement system funded in an actuarially\\n sound manner.\\n C.\\n [4] These Defendants also argue that even assuming Plaintiffs\\n had a contractual right to a retirement system funded in an\\n actuarially sound manner and that Defendants' actions impaired that\\n contract, any impairment was reasonable and necessary to serve an\\n important public purpose. Defendants contend that \"it has been\\n stipulated that the escrow of employer contributions mandated by\\n Executive Order No. 3 was for the sole purpose of fulfilling the\\n constitutional requirement to balance the State budget.\"\\n Therefore, Defendants argue, the escrow of the employer\\n contributions was reasonable and necessary to serve the important\\n public purpose of avoiding a constitutionally prohibited budget\\n deficit.\\n Article III, section 5(3) of the North Carolina Constitution\\n provides:\\n -24-\\n The total expenditures of the State for the\\n fiscal period covered by the budget shall not\\n exceed the total of receipts during that\\n fiscal period and the surplus remaining in the\\n State Treasury at the beginning of the period.\\n To insure that the State does not incur a\\n deficit for any fiscal period, the Governor\\n shall continually survey the collection of the\\n revenue and shall effect the necessary\\n economies in State expenditures[.]\\n N.C. Const. art. III, § 5(3). As our Court has recognized, \"[t]his\\n provision clearly places a duty upon the Governor to balance the\\n budget and prevent a deficit.\" County of Cabarrus v. Tolson, 169\\n N.C. App. 636, 638, 610 S.E.2d 443, 445, disc. review denied, 359\\n N.C. 630, 616 S.E.2d 229 (2005).\\n We agree with the trial court and with Defendants that the\\n avoidance of a constitutionally prohibited budget deficit is\\n clearly an important public purpose. However, we also agree with\\n the trial court that the escrow of the funds in the present case\\n was not reasonable and necessary to achieve that purpose. As we\\n recognized in our earlier discussion of Article V, section 6(2) of\\n the North Carolina Constitution, retirement funds specifically\\n receive special constitutional protection in North Carolina.\\n Article V, section 6(2) of the North Carolina Constitution plainly\\n provides that the State may not use retirement funds for any\\n purpose other than \"retirement system benefits and purposes,\\n administrative expenses, and refunds[.]\" N.C. Const. art. V, §\\n 6(2). This constitutional provision demonstrates the strong public\\n policy of North Carolina in favor of the inviolability of\\n retirement funds. See John V. Orth, The North Carolina State\\n Constitution 127 (1993) (stating: \"By constitutional amendment,\\n -25-\\n approved in 1950 and carried forward into the 1971 Constitution,\\n teachers and state employees secured constitutional protection for\\n their retirement funds; in 1971 local government employees were\\n given the same protection. Money in the funds may not even be\\n loaned to the state.\" (emphasis added)). Defendants argue that the\\n constitutional protection of Retirement System funds extends only\\n to those funds actually held by the Retirement System and that it\\n is not against public policy to use funds not yet received by the\\n Retirement System to balance the budget. Again, we reject this\\n argument. As we held above, the escrow of the employer\\n contributions was a diversion of Retirement System funds that was\\n prohibited by the North Carolina Constitution.\\n Our Supreme Court in Bailey considered whether the impairment\\n at issue in that case was reasonable and necessary to serve an\\n important public purpose. Bailey, 348 N.C. at 151-53, 500 S.E.2d\\n at 66-67. Our Supreme Court recognized:\\n \"In applying this standard, . . . complete\\n deference to a legislative assessment of\\n reasonableness and necessity is not\\n appropriate because the State's self-interest\\n is at stake. A governmental entity can always\\n find a use for extra money, especially when\\n taxes do not have to be raised. If a State\\n could reduce its financial obligations\\n whenever it wanted to spend the money for what\\n it regarded as an important public purpose,\\n the Contract Clause would provide no\\n protection at all.\"\\n Id. at 151-52, 500 S.E.2d at 66 (quoting United States Trust Co. v.\\n New Jersey, 431 U.S. 1, 25-26, 52 L. Ed. 2d 92, 112, reh'g denied,\\n 431 U.S. 975, 53 L. Ed. 2d 1073 (1977)). Our Supreme Court thus\\n held:\\n -26-\\n While it is clear that the state interest in\\n this case — complying with a Supreme Court\\n ruling — was important, what is equally clear\\n is that the method chosen was not necessary to\\n achieve the state interest asserted. In\\n Davis, the Supreme Court did not tell North\\n Carolina that it was required to tax state and\\n local employees; nor did it set forth any\\n mandatory scheme of compliance. Davis v.\\n Michigan Dep't of Treasury, 489 U.S. 803, 103\\n L. Ed. 2d 891. The Court merely held that\\n federal retirees had to be treated the same as\\n state and local retirees. Id. There are\\n numerous ways that the State could have\\n achieved this goal without impairing the\\n contractual obligations of [the] plaintiffs.\\n Id. at 152, 500 S.E.2d at 67.\\n As in Bailey, we cannot say in the case before us that \"the\\n method chosen\" of diverting employer contributions to the\\n Retirement System was \"necessary to achieve the state interest\\n asserted.\" See id. A balanced budget could have been achieved in\\n another way without diverting Retirement System funds that have\\n been afforded special constitutional protection.\\n Our Supreme Court further held in Bailey that\\n the method chosen was not reasonable under the\\n circumstances. The legislature sought a\\n \"revenue neutral\" approach to complying with\\n the Davis decision, meaning that legislators\\n would be faced with neither raising taxes nor\\n cutting other programs in order to comply.\\n However, this convenient approach impaired\\n vested rights of current and future state and\\n local retirees to whom the State had made\\n promises of exemption in consideration of\\n their many years of public service.\\n Id.\\n Similarly, in the present case, instead of seeking a tax\\n increase or cuts in other State programs that did not enjoy special\\n constitutional protection, Defendants diverted the employer\\n -27-\\n contributions to the Retirement System. Our Court cannot say that\\n this diversion, which impaired the contractual right of Plaintiffs\\n to a retirement system funded in an actuarially sound manner, was\\n reasonable.\\n For the reasons stated above, we hold that the trial court did\\n not err by granting summary judgment to Plaintiffs regarding their\\n claim for declaratory judgment under the Contract Clause. Because\\n we affirm the judgment of the trial court for Plaintiffs on the\\n merits of their declaratory judgment claims under Article V,\\n section 6(2) of the North Carolina Constitution and under the\\n Contract Clause of the United States Constitution, we need not\\n address Plaintiffs' cross-assignments of error.\\n Plaintiffs' Appeal\\n [5] Plaintiffs argue the trial court erred by granting summary\\n judgment to the Treasurer and to the Board on Plaintiffs' claim for\\n writ of mandamus to compel compliance with N.C. Gen. Stat. § 135-\\n 8(f)(3). N.C. Gen. Stat. § 135-8(f)(3) provides:\\n In the event the employee or employer\\n contributions required under this section are\\n not received by the date set by the Board of\\n Trustees, the Board shall assess the employer\\n with a penalty of 1% per month with a minimum\\n penalty of twenty-five dollars ($25.00). If\\n within 90 days after request therefor by the\\n Board any employer shall not have provided the\\n System with the records and other information\\n required hereunder or if the full accrued\\n amount of the contributions provided for under\\n this section due from members employed by an\\n employer or from an employer other than the\\n State shall not have been received by the\\n System from the chief fiscal officer of such\\n employer within 30 days after the last due\\n date as herein provided, then, notwithstanding\\n anything herein or in the provisions of any\\n -28-\\n other law to the contrary, upon notification\\n by the Board to the State Treasurer as to the\\n default of such employer as herein provided,\\n any distributions which might otherwise be\\n made to such employer from any funds of the\\n State shall be withheld from such employer\\n until notice from the Board to the State\\n Treasurer that such employer is no longer in\\n default.\\n N.C. Gen. Stat. § 135-8(f)(3) (2007) (emphases added). Based upon\\n the first sentence of the statute, Plaintiffs argue that because\\n the employer contributions diverted pursuant to Executive Order No.\\n 3 were not \"received\" by the Retirement System when they were due,\\n the Board should have assessed a one percent per month penalty to\\n those employers. Plaintiffs further argue that pursuant to the\\n second sentence of the statute, all State funds should have been\\n withheld from employers whose employer contributions were not\\n received by the Retirement System \"within 30 days after the last\\n due date as [therein] provided[.]\" We disagree.\\n The statute speaks in terms of a default by an employer. The\\n term \"default\" is defined as the \"[f]ailure to perform a task or\\n fulfill an obligation, esp. failure to meet a financial\\n obligation.\" Webster's II New College Dictionary 301 (3d ed.\\n 2005); see also Black's Law Dictionary 449 (8th ed. 2004) (defining\\n \"default\" as \"[t]he omission or failure to perform a legal or\\n contractual duty; esp., the failure to pay a debt when due\"). In\\n the present case, the State employers did not default on their\\n obligation to remit their employer contributions to the Retirement\\n System. State employers calculated the amount of their employer\\n contributions to the Retirement System, but then were ordered to\\n -29-\\n pay those amounts into the escrow account. As the trial court\\n found,\\n the fact that the employer contributions\\n affected by Executive Order No. 3 were not\\n received by the Retirement System was neither\\n the result of the intent of any employers to\\n withhold contributions nor of negligence on\\n the part of any employers, but rather was the\\n result of an intervening executive order that\\n employers were bound to follow unless and\\n until directed otherwise by competent\\n authority.\\n Moreover, as the trial court found,\\n [f]or several years prior to and following the\\n issuance of Executive Order No. 3, the\\n Department of State Treasurer had routinely\\n waived the imposition of the 1% per month fine\\n provided in N.C. Gen. Stat. § 135-8(f)(3) for\\n employers from whom the System had not\\n received required payments when due when the\\n Department of State Treasurer determined, in\\n its discretion, that the employer had\\n demonstrated lack of intent to fail to remit\\n the contributions in a timely manner.\\n N.C. Gen. Stat. § 135-6(f) (2007) provides: \"The Board of Trustees\\n shall also, from time to time, in its discretion, adopt rules and\\n regulations to prevent injustices and inequalities which might\\n otherwise arise in the administration of this Chapter.\" The\\n Board's practice of waiving penalties under circumstances where\\n employers were not at fault for failing to remit employer\\n contributions to the Retirement System is entirely consistent with\\n the Board's statutory discretion to adopt rules \"to prevent\\n injustices.\" Accordingly, for all the reasons stated above, the\\n Treasurer and the Board were not required to punish those employers\\n whose employer contributions were not deposited in the Retirement\\n System. Therefore, we hold the trial court did not err by granting\\n -30-\\n summary judgment to the Treasurer and to the Board on Plaintiffs'\\n claim for writ of mandamus.\\n Affirmed.\\n Judges WYNN and CALABRIA concur.\"\"\"\n",

For\\n -2-\\n the reasons stated herein, we reverse and remand this case to the\\n trial court.\\n On 15 July 2005, Konstantin Mnatsakanov received a letter from\\n Nationwide notifying him that his Homeowner’s Policy would not\\n renew on 31 October 2005 because he had a Rottweiler dog on the\\n premises. On 15 July 2005, Konstantin Mnatsakanov met with\\n Nationwide agent Gary Griffith and requested that his policy not be\\n cancelled on 31 October 2005 but that it be renewed. After\\n contacting Nationwide Underwriting, Griffith advised Konstantin\\n that the policy would be renewed if Konstantin agreed to a\\n restriction of coverage for any occurrence caused by his dog as set\\n forth on the “Restriction of Individual Policies” (Endorsement H-\\n 7030A). Konstantin agreed to the restriction. Both he and\\n Griffith signed the “Restriction of Individual Policies” on 15 July\\n 2005. The “Restriction of Individual Policies,” (H-7030-A)\\n exempted from coverage any claim brought against the insured\\n “caused by any animal, owned or in the care of the insured.”\\n However, the restriction did not state an effective date.\\n Melissa McCalister filed a claim for personal injuries that\\n occurred 13 October 2005 when she was bitten by a dog owned by the\\n Mnatsakanovs. The Mnatsakanovs requested coverage under the\\n Nationwide policy for the claim asserted by McCalister. Nationwide\\n filed a Declaratory Judgment action naming the Mnatsakanovs and\\n -3-\\n McCalister as defendants and asking the trial court to determine if\\n the insurance policy covered McCalister’s claim. Nationwide\\n thereafter moved for summary judgment asking the trial court to\\n find as a matter of law that the policy excluded coverage for the\\n dog bite injury suffered by McCalister on the Mnatsakanov’s\\n property.\\n The trial court found that the effective date of the\\n “Restriction of Individual Policies” was 15 July 2005, the date it\\n was signed by Nationwide Policyholder Konstantin Mnatsakanov and\\n Nationwide agent Gary Griffith. The trial court found that in\\n exchange for agreeing to the restriction, Nationwide promised not\\n to cancel the Mnatsakanov’s policy on 31 October 2005 but renew the\\n Policy for another year. The trial court found that Nationwide’s\\n agreement to not cancel the Mnatsakanov’s policy on 31 October 2005\\n and renew the policy for another year constituted adequate\\n consideration for the Restriction of Individual Policies signed by\\n Mr. Mnatsakanov and Nationwide Agent Griffith.\\n Based on those findings, the trial court concluded that the\\n effective date of the modification of the Nationwide Policy as set\\n forth in the “Restriction of Individual Policies” was 15 July 2005;\\n the renewal of the policy from 31 October 2005 through 31 October\\n 2006 constituted adequate consideration for the 15 July 2005\\n modification of the policy; and the language set forth in the\\n -4-\\n “Restriction of Individual Policies” effectively excluded any\\n liability coverage or medical payments coverage for injuries\\n sustained by McCalister. On these grounds, the trial court granted\\n summary judgment in favor of Nationwide.\\n Konstantin Mnatsakanov, Liana Mnatsakanov, Amiran Mnatsakanov\\n and Melissa McCalister (collectively “defendants”) appealed.\\n ____________________________________\\n Defendants present six issues on appeal: whether the trial\\n court committed reversible error by (I) granting summary judgment\\n for Nationwide; (II) finding as fact that the effective date of the\\n endorsement of the “Restriction of Individual Policies” was 15 July\\n 2005; (III) finding as fact that Nationwide agreed not to cancel\\n the Mnatsakanov’s policy in exchange for signing the restriction on\\n 15 July 2005; (IV) finding that no coverage existed for Melissa\\n McCalister’s injury claim; (V) concluding that the effective date\\n of the restriction on the policy was 15 July 2005; and (VI) finding\\n that the renewal of the policy was consideration for restricting\\n the policy on the date it was signed.\\n [1] Because the dispositive issue is whether there was a\\n genuine issue of material fact as to the effective date of the\\n endorsement of the “Restriction of Individual Policies,” and\\n because many of defendant’s other issues violate our appellate\\n rules, we do not reach those other issues. See N.C.R. App. P.\\n -5-\\n 28(b)(6) (2007) (“assignments of error not set out in the\\n appellant’s brief, or in support of which no reason or argument is\\n stated or authority cited, are deemed abandoned”).\\n Standard of Review\\n Where a motion for summary judgment has been granted, the two\\n critical questions on appeal are whether, on the basis of the\\n materials presented to the trial court, (1) there is no genuine\\n issue of material fact, and (2) the moving party is entitled to\\n judgment as a matter of law. North River Ins. Co. v. Young, 117\\n N.C. App. 663, 667, 453 S.E.2d 205, 208 (1995).\\n An issue is material if the facts alleged are\\n such as to constitute a legal defense or are\\n of such nature as to affect the result of the\\n action, or if the resolution of the issue is\\n so essential that the party against whom it is\\n resolved may not prevail.\\n Kessing v. Mortgage Corp., 278 N.C. 523, 534, 180 S.E.2d 823, 830\\n (1971). Moreover, the evidence presented by the parties must be\\n viewed in the light most favorable to the non-movant. Bruce-\\n Terminix Co. v. Zurich Ins. Co., 130 N.C. App. 729, 733, 504 S.E.2d\\n 574, 577 (1998). “Review of summary judgment on appeal is\\n necessarily limited to whether the trial court’s conclusion as to\\n these questions of laws were correct ones.” Young, 117 N.C. App.\\n at 667, 453 S.E.2d at 208. Hence, the standard of review of an\\n order granting summary judgment is de novo. Diggs v. Novant\\n -6-\\n Health, Inc., 177 N.C. App. 290, 294, 628 S.E.2d 851, 855 (2006).\\n ___________________________________\\n [2] Defendants argue the trial court erred by finding and\\n concluding that the effective date of the “Restriction of\\n Individual Policies” was 15 July 2005. We agree.\\n “The heart of a contract is the intention of the parties,\\n which is to be ascertained from the expressions used, the subject\\n matter, the end in view, the purpose sought, and the situation of\\n the parties at the time.” Gould Morris Elec. Co. v. Atlantic Fire\\n Ins. Co., 229 N.C. 518, 520, 50 S.E.2d 295, 297 (1948). “It is\\n essential to the formation of any contract that there be mutual\\n assent of both parties to the terms of the agreement so as to\\n establish a meeting of the minds.” Creech v. Melnik, 347 N.C. 520,\\n 527, 495 S.E.2d 907, 911-12 (1998). “This rule of contract law is\\n founded on the proposition that there can be no contract without a\\n meeting of the minds.” Cunningham v. Brown, 51 N.C. App. 264, 270,\\n 276 S.E.2d 718, 723 (1981). “Whether mutual assent is established\\n and whether a contract was intended between parties are questions\\n for the trier of fact.” Creech, 347 N.C. at 527, 495 S.E.2d at\\n 911.\\n In the instant case, defendants contend that the “Restriction\\n of Individual Policies” was written to apply beginning on 31\\n October 2005, the renewal date of the policy. There was no\\n -7-\\n indication on the “Restriction of Individual Policies” form as to\\n when the exclusion would take effect. Nationwide agent Griffith\\n testified in his deposition that “the practice of Nationwide would\\n be to send a letter to the insured letting him know that his\\n coverage is continued.” Griffith stated he knew Nationwide had the\\n ability to non-renew a policy, but not whether they had the right\\n to cancel the policy immediately. When asked if there was any\\n correspondence regarding renewal of coverage, he said, “renewal\\n notices may or may not be in the file [for the Mnatsakanovs].”\\n Agent Griffith also testified that he “could not answer for\\n Nationwide if it was a requirement that the exclusion take effect\\n in July for a renewal date in October.”\\n To the contrary, Nationwide argues that the “Restriction of\\n Individual Policies” was effective on 15 July 2005, the day\\n Konstantin Mnatsakanov signed the exclusion. Nationwide argues\\n Konstantin Mnatsakanov understood verbally and in writing, that the\\n agreement was effective immediately. In his deposition, Agent\\n Griffith testified that “it was explained to Mr. Mnatsakanov that\\n effective immediately, 15 July 2005, there is no coverage for the\\n dog, and he verbally expressed that he understood.” Moreover,\\n Griffith testified that “Konstantin Mnatsakanov was informed by the\\n underwriter while he was in the office that if he was willing to\\n sign an endorsement provided by Nationwide, which he understood\\n -8-\\n completely, there would be no coverage with his signature for any\\n liability involving the dog.” In summary, Nationwide argues that\\n Griffith’s testimony provided that the exclusion signed 15 July\\n 2005 was effective immediately because “the dog was a danger to\\n society; [to] families living around the Mnatsakanovs; the sooner\\n that Konstantin understood what would be covered and not covered,\\n the better he understood it took place immediately.”\\n Because the “Restriction of Individual Policies” excluded any\\n liability for a claim or suit brought against an insured for any\\n occurrence involving a dog and its effective date bears upon the\\n determination that the Mnatsakanov’s Nationwide insurance policy\\n covers damages for the dog bite injury to McCalister, we believe a\\n genuine issue of material fact exists as to when the “Restriction\\n of Individual Policies” was effective. Accordingly, we reverse the\\n trial court’s grant of summary judgment and remand for further\\n proceedings.\\n Reversed and remanded.\\n Judges HUNTER and JACKSON concur.\"\"\"\n",

Because we hold that neither the public duty doctrine\\n nor public officers’ immunity protects the defendants from\\n liability, we affirm the trial court’s partial denial of the\\n defendants’ motion for summary judgment.\\n On 4 September 2002, Herman Rouse, Plaintiff Joy Murray’s\\n contractor and builder, applied for an improvement permit from the\\n Person County Health Department. On 6 November 2002, Defendant\\n Adam Sarver, an Environmental Health Specialist for the Person\\n County Health Department, conducted a site evaluation on Ms.\\n Murray’s property and issued an improvement permit approving the\\n installation of an innovative wastewater treatment system on the\\n property. The improvement permit stated that “[n]either Person\\n County nor the Environmental Health Specialist warrants that the\\n septic tank system will continue to function satisfactorily in the\\n future or that the water supply will remain potable.”\\n On 13 March 2003, an innovative wastewater treatment system\\n was installed on Ms. Murray’s property. On 19 March 2003, Mr.\\n Sarver issued an Operation Permit, indicating that the system had\\n been installed in compliance with statutory law.\\n The construction of Ms. Murray’s home was completed in March\\n 2003 and she moved into the home in April 2003. Shortly after she\\n moved in, Ms. Murray noticed water surfacing on her property and\\n -3-\\n she notified Mr. Rouse. Mr. Rouse visited Ms. Murray’s property\\n and informed her that she had a problem with her septic system.\\n Ms. Murray reported the problems with her wastewater system to\\n the county, and over the next several months, Mr. Sarver, along\\n with Defendant Harold Kelly, another Environmental Health\\n Specialist, and Defendant Janet Clayton, an Environmental Health\\n Supervisor, made numerous unsuccessful attempts to repair Ms.\\n Murray’s wastewater system. These attempts involved multiple\\n inspections and observations of the wastewater system, the issuance\\n of permits for the installation of a new line, and eventually, the\\n installation of a new innovative system. However, the new\\n innovative wastewater treatment system, installed in February 2004,\\n also failed.\\n On 15 June 2006, Ms. Murray initiated this action against\\n Person County and the Person County Health Department; and against\\n Mr. Sarver, Ms. Clayton, and Mr. Kelly, individually and in their\\n official capacities. She alleged negligence, negligent\\n misrepresentation, and negligent infliction of emotional distress\\n in the issuance of permits for the installation and repair of her\\n wastewater treatment system.\\n On 29 May 2007, Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment\\n as to all of Ms. Murray’s claims. The trial court heard\\n Defendants’ motion on 24 July 2007 and granted Defendants’ motion\\n as to all claims against Person County and the Person County Health\\n Department; and Mr. Sarver, Ms. Clayton, and Mr. Kelly in their\\n official capacities. The trial court also granted summary judgment\\n -4-\\n on Ms. Murray’s claim of negligent infliction of emotional\\n distress. However, the trial court denied summary judgment as to\\n Ms. Murray’s claims for negligence and negligent misrepresentation\\n against Mr. Sarver, Ms. Clayton, and Mr. Kelly in their individual\\n capacities.\\n [1] On appeal, Mr. Sarver, Ms. Clayton, and Mr. Kelly\\n (collectively “Defendants”) argue the trial court erred by\\n partially denying their motion for summary judgment. Specifically,\\n Defendants contend that they are entitled to the protection of the\\n public duty doctrine and public officers’ immunity. Though\\n interlocutory, Defendants’ appeal from the denial of summary\\n judgment is properly before this Court because appeals which\\n present defenses of governmental or sovereign immunity, like the\\n public duty doctrine or public officers’ immunity, have been held\\n by this Court to be immediately appealable as affecting a\\n substantial right.

Bruce-Terminix Co. v. Zurich Ins.\\n Co., 130 N.C. App. 729, 733, 504 S.E.2d 574, 577 (1998). Though we\\n view the evidence presented by the parties in the light most\\n -5-\\n favorable to the non-movant, summary judgment is appropriate when\\n “(1) an essential element of plaintiff’s claim is nonexistent[,]\\n (2) plaintiff cannot produce evidence to support an essential\\n element of his claim, or (3) plaintiff cannot surmount an\\n affirmative defense which would bar the claim.” Gibson v. Mutual\\n Life Ins. Co. of New York, 121 N.C. App. 284, 286, 465 S.E.2d 56,\\n 58 (1996).\\n [2] Defendants first argue the trial court erred by denying\\n summary judgment on the claims of negligence and negligent\\n misrepresentation in their individual capacities because they are\\n protected from liability by the public duty doctrine. We disagree.\\n The public duty doctrine “provides that governmental entities\\n and their agents owe duties only to the general public, not to\\n individuals, absent a ‘special relationship’ or ‘special duty’\\n between the entity and the injured party.” Stone v. North Carolina\\n Dept. of Labor, 347 N.C. 473, 477-78, 495 S.E.2d 711, 714 (citation\\n omitted), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1016, 142 L.

The purpose of the public duty\\n doctrine is “to prevent an overwhelming burden of liability on\\n governmental agencies with limited resources.” Id. at 481, 495\\n S.E.2d at 716 (internal citations omitted).\\n Although the public duty doctrine was initially adopted in the\\n context of municipal law enforcement, Braswell v.

App. at 180, 641 S.E.2d at 815.\\n S.E.2d 550 (1992), our Supreme Court has extended the public duty\\n doctrine “to claims against the State under the Tort Claims Act,”\\n Stone, 347 N.C. at 482, 495 S.E.2d at 716, and “to state agencies\\n required by statute to conduct inspections for the public’s general\\n protection.” Lovelace v.

North\\n Carolina Dept. of Env’t. and Natural Resources, 182 N.C.

Our Supreme Court has explained: “A suit against\\n a defendant in his individual capacity means that the plaintiff\\n seeks recovery from the defendant directly; a suit against a\\n -7-\\n defendant in his official capacity means that the plaintiff seeks\\n recovery from the entity of which the public servant defendant is\\n an agent.” Meyer v. Walls, 347 N.C. 97, 110, 489 S.E.2d 880, 887\\n (1997).\\n Here, the only claims remaining against Defendants are in\\n their individual capacities. Where a governmental worker is sued\\n in his individual capacity, rather than applying the public duty\\n doctrine, our courts have consistently applied public officers’\\n immunity. See Isenhour v. Hutto, 350 N.C. 601, 609, 517 S.E.2d\\n 121, 127 (1999) (“Once we determine the aggrieved party has\\n sufficiently pled a claim against defendant in his or her\\n individual capacity, we must determine whether that defendant is a\\n public official or a public employee.”); Epps v. Duke Univ., Inc.,\\n 122 N.C. App. 198, 205, 468 S.E.2d 846, 851-52 (1996) (“To sustain\\n the personal or individual capacity suit, the plaintiff must\\n initially make a prima facie showing that the defendant-official’s\\n tortious conduct falls within one of the immunity exceptions[.]”);\\n EEE-ZZZ Lay Drain Co. v. North Carolina Dept. of Human Res., 108\\n N.C.

In distinguishing between a public\\n official and a public employee, our courts have held that “(1) a\\n public office is a position created by the constitution or\\n statutes; (2) a public official exercises a portion of the\\n sovereign power; and (3) a public official exercises discretion,\\n while public employees perform ministerial duties.” Isenhour, 350\\n N.C. at 610, 517 S.E.2d at 127.

Jenkins in Onslow County Superior Court. Heard in the\\n Court of Appeals 19 March 2008.\\n Edwin L. West, III, for Defendant-Appellant.\\n Ward and Smith, P.A., by J. Michael Fields and John P. Crolle,\\n for Plaintiff-Appellee.\\n STEPHENS, Judge.\\n This case concerns the adequacy of the means employed by the\\n Sheriff of Onslow County to provide notice to Defendant William C.\\n Johnson of the pending execution sale of his condominium unit.\\n -2-\\n I. FACTS\\n Defendant was the owner of condominium unit 2107 located in\\n the St. Regis condominium complex in Onslow County, North Carolina.\\n Plaintiff St. Regis of Onslow County, North Carolina Owners\\n Association, Inc., filed a Claim of Lien against Defendant to\\n enforce assessments due and owed to Plaintiff for homeowner’s dues\\n for the condominium unit. Plaintiff subsequently filed a complaint\\n against Defendant on 25 March 1999 to recover the delinquent\\n assessments.\\n On 6 March 2000, judgment was entered against Defendant upon\\n Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment. By this order and\\n judgment, Plaintiff was entitled to recover from Defendant\\n $10,063.66, plus court costs, attorney’s fees of $551.54, and\\n interest at a rate of eight percent per annum from the date of the\\n filing of the complaint. Plaintiff was also allowed to foreclose\\n its lien on the property and to sell the property to satisfy\\n Defendant’s debt to Plaintiff. Also on 6 March 2000, the judgment\\n lien was docketed in Onslow County in Judgment Docket Book 87 on\\n page 236.\\n On 4 April 2003, approximately three years after the entry of\\n judgment, Defendant deeded the subject real property to the Johnson\\n Family Trust (“Trust”). The deed on its face requested that the\\n Register of Deeds mail the recorded deed to Defendant at 39 Pitney\\n Lane, Jackson, New Jersey 08527.\\n On 5 January 2006, the Onslow County Clerk of Superior Court\\n (“Clerk”) issued a Writ of Execution to the Sheriff of Onslow\\n -3-\\n County (“Sheriff”). On 30 January 2006, the Sheriff mailed, via\\n registered mail, a letter and a Notice of Sale of Real Property\\n Under an Execution (“Notice”) to Defendant at 39 Pitney Lane,\\n Jackson, New Jersey 08527. The letter stated: “Under and by\\n virtue of a Judgment rendered against Defendant in the referenced\\n action, an execution was issued by the Court on the 5[th] day of\\n January, 2006, and directed to the Sheriff of Onslow County.” The\\n Notice further provided: “The sale will be held on the 6[th] day of\\n March, 2006, at 11:30 o’clock a.m., at the Onslow County\\n Courthouse.”\\n On 27 January 2006, the Sheriff posted the Notice at the\\n Onslow County Courthouse in the area designated by the Clerk for\\n the posting of notices. On 3 February, and again on 9 February\\n 2006, the United States Postal Service notified Defendant of the\\n Sheriff’s registered mail envelope, but Defendant did not claim the\\n envelope. On 20 February and 1 March 2006, the Sheriff published\\n the Notice in the Jacksonville Daily News.\\n On 6 March 2006, the Sheriff conducted the execution sale.\\n Floyd B. McKissick, Jr., the President of the Plaintiff owners\\n association, submitted the winning bid of $87,000. On 10 March\\n 2006, Mr. McKissick paid the purchase price, and on 31 March 2006,\\n a Sheriff’s Deed conveying the property to Mr. McKissick was\\n recorded. On 27 April 2006, the registered mail envelope\\n containing the letter and Notice was returned to the Sheriff marked\\n “unclaimed.”\\n -4-\\n On 5 March 2007, Defendant, along with the Trust, trustees\\n Karen Gillen and William M. Johnson, and trust beneficiaries\\n William Charles Johnson, Jr., Christopher Michael Johnson, and\\n Stacy Lynn Johnson (collectively “Movants”) filed a Motion to Set\\n Aside Execution Sale, Order Confirming Execution Sale, and the\\n Sheriff’s Deed Issued to the Execution Sale Purchaser pursuant to\\n North Carolina Civil Procedure Rule 60. On 16 April 2007, Movants\\n filed an Amended Motion.\\n On 23 April 2007, a hearing was conducted on the motion, and\\n an order denying the motion was entered on 2 May 2007. From this\\n order, Defendant, joined by the Rule 60 Movants, appeals.\\n II. DISCUSSION\\n By Defendant’s nine assignments of error, he argues the trial\\n court erred in denying his motion for relief pursuant to N.C. Gen.\\n Stat. § 1A-1, Rule 60(b)(6) because the notice of the execution\\n sale provided by the Sheriff did not meet due process requirements.\\n Under Rule 60(b), the trial court may “relieve a party or his\\n legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding”\\n for the reasons specified in Rule 60(b)(1) – (5). N.C. Gen. Stat.\\n § 1A-1, Rule 60(b) (2005). Rule 60(b)(6) permits the trial court\\n to grant relief for any other reason “justifying relief from the\\n operation of the judgment.” Id. This provision “authorizes the\\n trial judge to exercise his discretion in granting or withholding\\n the relief sought.” Kennedy v. Starr, 62 N.C. App. 182, 186, 302\\n S.E.2d 497, 499-500, disc. review denied, 309 N.C. 321, 307 S.E.2d\\n 164 (1983).\\n -5-\\n On appeal, this Court’s review of a trial court’s Rule 60(b)\\n ruling “is limited to determining whether the trial court abused\\n its discretion.” Vaughn v. Vaughn, 99 N.C. App. 574, 575, 393\\n S.E.2d 567, 568, disc. review denied, 327 N.C. 488, 397 S.E.2d 238\\n (1990). An abuse of discretion is shown only when the court’s\\n decision “is manifestly unsupported by reason or is so arbitrary\\n that it could not have been the result of a reasoned decision.”\\n State v. McDonald, 130 N.C. App. 263, 267, 502 S.E.2d 409, 413\\n (1998) (citation omitted).\\n The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United\\n States Constitution, as applied to the states by the Fourteenth\\n Amendment, and Article 1, section 19, of the North Carolina\\n Constitution, prohibit the government from depriving any person of\\n his or her property without due process of law. Due process does\\n not require that a property owner receive actual notice before the\\n government may take his property. Dusenbery v. United States, 534\\n U.S. 161, 151 L. Ed. 2d 597 (2002). Rather, due process requires\\n the government to provide “notice reasonably calculated, under all\\n the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of\\n the action and afford them an opportunity to present their\\n objections.” McLean v. McLean, 233 N.C. 139, 143, 63 S.E.2d 138,\\n 146 (1951) (quoting Mullane v. Cent. Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339\\n U.S. 306, 314, 94 L. Ed. 865, 873 (1950)). “Whether a party has\\n adequate notice is a question of law.” Trivette v. Trivette, 162\\n N.C. App. 55, 58, 590 S.E.2d 298, 302 (2004).\\n -6-\\n [1] Defendant first argues that Movants were entitled to\\n receive “personal notice” of the impending sale of the property.\\n Specifically, Defendant argues that the language of N.C. Gen. Stat.\\n § 1-339.54 makes it clear that Defendant, as the judgment debtor,\\n was entitled to personal notice of the sale of the condominium\\n unit. We disagree.\\n Pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1-339.54, the sheriff must\\n comply with the following procedure for notifying a judgment debtor\\n of the sale of real property:\\n [T]he sheriff shall, at least ten days before\\n the sale of real property,\\n (1) If the judgment debtor is found in the\\n county, serve a copy of the notice of sale on\\n him personally, or\\n (2) If the judgment debtor is not found in the\\n county,\\n a. Send a copy of the notice of sale by\\n registered mail to the judgment debtor at\\n his last address known to the sheriff,\\n and\\n b. Serve a copy of the notice of sale on\\n the judgment debtor’s agent, if there is\\n in the county a person known to the\\n sheriff to be an agent who has custody or\\n management of, or who exercises control\\n over, any property in the county\\n belonging to the judgment debtor.\\n N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1-339.54 (2005). Additionally, the sheriff must\\n comply with the following procedure for posting and publishing\\n notice of an execution sale of real property:\\n (a) The notice of sale of real property shall:\\n (1) Be posted, in the area designated by\\n the clerk of superior court for the\\n posting of notices in the county in which\\n -7-\\n the property is situated, for at least 20\\n days immediately preceding the sale; and\\n (2) Be published once a week for at least\\n two successive weeks:\\n a. In a newspaper qualified for\\n legal advertising published in the\\n county; or\\n b. If no newspaper qualified for\\n legal advertising is published in\\n the county, in a newspaper having\\n general circulation in the county.\\n (b) When the notice of sale is published in a\\n newspaper:\\n (1) The period from the date of the first\\n publication to the date of the last\\n publication, both dates inclusive, shall\\n not be less than seven days, including\\n Sundays; and\\n (2) The date of the last publication\\n shall be not more than 10 days preceding\\n the date of the sale.\\n N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1-339.52 (2005).\\n As Defendant was not located in Onslow County, he was not\\n entitled to have a copy of the Notice served on him personally\\n pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1-339.54(1). Furthermore, there was\\n no evidence that Defendant had an agent in Onslow County upon whom\\n the Sheriff was required to personally serve a copy of the Notice\\n pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1-339.54(2)b. Accordingly, here, at\\n least ten days before the sale of the property, the Sheriff was\\n required to “[s]end a copy of the [N]otice [] by registered mail to\\n [Defendant] at his last address known to the [S]heriff[.]” N.C.\\n Gen. Stat. § 1-339.54(2)a. The Sheriff complied with this mandate\\n by sending the Notice via registered mail on 30 January 2006, more\\n -8-\\n than 30 days prior to the sale of the property on 6 March 2006, to\\n 39 Pitney Lane, Jackson, New Jersey 08527, Defendant’s last address\\n known to the Sheriff.\\n [2] Defendant also alleges that the Trust, as the owner of the\\n unit at the time of the sale, and the Trust beneficiaries, as\\n parties with legally protected interests, were entitled to receive\\n personal notice of the impending execution sale. Again, we\\n disagree.\\n In Scott v. Paisley, 271 U.S. 632, 70 L. Ed. 1123 (1926), the\\n plaintiff purchased a tract of land that was subject to a priorrecorded\\n security deed executed by the previous owner. After the\\n plaintiff purchased the land, the previous owner defaulted on the\\n note secured by the property. Without notice to the plaintiff, the\\n creditor brought suit against the former owner of the land.\\n Judgment was entered in the creditor’s favor and the sheriff\\n subsequently executed on the land. After the required\\n advertisement of the sale, the property was sold at public sale in\\n satisfaction of the judgment. The plaintiff brought suit to set\\n aside the sale because she was not provided with notice of the\\n sale. In concluding that the validity of the sale was not\\n affected, nor were the plaintiff’s due process rights violated, by\\n the fact that notice of the sale was not given to the plaintiff,\\n the United States Supreme Court stated:\\n A purchaser of land on which there is a prior\\n security deed acquires his interest in the\\n property subject to the right of the holder of\\n the secured debt to exercise the statutory\\n power of sale. There is no established\\n principle of law which entitles such a\\n -9-\\n purchaser to notice of the exercise of this\\n power.\\n Id. at 636, 70 L. Ed. at 1125.\\n Here, the Warranty Deed transferring the condominium unit from\\n Defendant to the Trust erroneously asserted that the property was\\n “free and clear of all encumbrances[.]” In fact, the property was\\n encumbered by a judgment lien which allowed Plaintiff to foreclose\\n its lien and exercise its power of sale to satisfy Defendant’s\\n debt. As in Scott, the Trust and the beneficiaries acquired their\\n interests in the property subject to the right of Plaintiff to\\n exercise its statutory power of sale. Furthermore, docketing a\\n judgment puts third parties on notice of the existence of a\\n judgment, and transferees are bound to look into the proper dockets\\n to examine for judgment liens. Jones v. Currie, 190 N.C. 260, 129\\n S.E. 605 (1925). While in Scott no judgment was docketed and the\\n defendant’s power of sale did not arise until after the plaintiff\\n had purchased the property, here, the judgment had been docketed on\\n 6 May 2000 in Onslow County in Judgment Docket Book 87 on page 236.\\n Thus, unlike the plaintiff in Scott who had no record notice of the\\n defendant’s power of sale, here the Trust had record notice of the\\n judgment lien allowing Plaintiff to exercise its power of sale to\\n satisfy Defendant’s debt. Accordingly, as in Scott, the Trust and\\n the beneficiaries were not entitled to personal notice of the\\n execution sale and the validity of the sale of the condominium was\\n not affected, nor were Movants’ due process rights violated, by the\\n fact that such notice was not given to the Trust or the\\n beneficiaries.\\n -10-\\n [3] Defendant next argues that N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1-339.54\\n “run[s] afoul” of due process requirements in that, under the\\n circumstances, the Sheriff was obligated to take “further\\n reasonable steps” to notify Defendant of the impending property\\n sale.\\n As stated above, individuals whose property interests are at\\n stake are entitled to “notice reasonably calculated, under all the\\n circumstances, to apprise [them] of the pendency of the action.”\\n Mullane, 339 U.S. at 314, 94 L. Ed. at 873. Whether a particular\\n method of notice is reasonable depends on the particular\\n circumstances and “[t]he means employed must be such as one\\n desirous of actually informing the absentee might reasonably adopt\\n to accomplish it.” Id. at 315, 94 L. Ed. at 874.\\n Thus, the issue is whether the notice in this case was\\n “reasonably calculated under all the circumstances” to apprise\\n Defendant of the pendency of the execution sale. The Sheriff sent\\n registered mail addressed to Defendant at Defendant’s last known\\n and actual address. Additionally, the Sheriff posted the Notice at\\n the Onslow County Courthouse in the area designated by the Clerk\\n for the posting of notices, and published the Notice in the\\n Jacksonville Daily News on two occasions.\\n Although Defendant contends that “the attempt at providing\\n notice solely by means of one attempt at sending notice via\\n registered mail was constitutionally inadequate to accord with due\\n process requirements under the law[,]” use of the postal service to\\n send a letter to a party is well-recognized as an adequate means of\\n -11-\\n 1 E.g., Mullane, 339 U.S. at 319, 94 L. Ed. at 876 (“[T]he\\n mails today are recognized as an efficient and inexpensive means of\\n communication.”); Walker v. City of Hutchinson, 352 U.S. 112, 116,\\n 1 L. Ed. 2d 178, 182 (1956) (“[T]he notice by publication here\\n falls short of the requirements of due process. . . . Even a\\n letter would have apprised [appellant] that his property was about\\n to be taken . . . .”); Schroeder v. City of New York, 371 U.S. 208,\\n 214, 9 L. Ed. 2d 255, 260 (1962) (“[T]he city was constitutionally\\n obliged to make at least a good faith effort to give [notice]\\n personally to the appellant – an obligation which the mailing of a\\n single letter would have discharged.”); Mennonite Bd. of Missions\\n v. Adams, 462 U.S. 791, 798, 77 L. Ed. 2d 180, 187 (1983) (“When\\n the mortgagee is identified in a mortgage that is publicly\\n recorded, constructive notice by publication must be supplemented\\n by notice mailed to the mortgagee’s last known available address,\\n or by personal service.”).\\n effecting notice upon known addressees when notice by publication\\n has been found to be insufficient.1 Dusenbery, 534 U.S. 161, 151\\n L. Ed. 2d 597. Defendant further claims that “Jones v. Flowers []\\n makes it clear that, if nothing else, one charged with providing\\n notice as to the impending loss of another’s property must send one\\n last notice, via regular United States mail, if the provider cannot\\n figure out a better way of providing personal notice.” We are of\\n the opinion, however, that Defendant’s interpretation and reliance\\n on Jones v. Flowers, 547 U.S. 220, 164 L. Ed. 2d 415 (2006), is\\n misplaced.\\n In Flowers, the Arkansas Commissioner of State Lands\\n (“Commissioner”) mailed a certified letter to the defendant to\\n notify him of his tax delinquency. The letter stated that unless\\n the defendant redeemed the property, the property would be subject\\n to public sale two years later. No one was home to sign for the\\n letter and nobody retrieved the letter from the post office within\\n the next fifteen days. The post office returned the unopened\\n -12-\\n letter to the Commissioner marked “unclaimed.” Id. at 224, 164 L.\\n Ed. 2d at 424.\\n Two years later, the Commissioner published a notice of public\\n sale in the newspaper several weeks before the sale. No bids were\\n submitted, permitting the State to negotiate a private sale of the\\n property. Several months later, Linda Flowers submitted a purchase\\n offer. The Commissioner then mailed another certified letter to\\n the defendant, attempting to notify him that his house would be\\n sold to Flowers if he did not redeem the property. Like the first\\n letter, the second was also returned to the Commissioner marked\\n “unclaimed.” Id. The property was subsequently sold to Flowers.\\n The defendant filed suit against the Commissioner and Flowers,\\n alleging that the Commissioner’s failure to provide notice of the\\n tax sale and of the defendant’s right to redeem his property\\n resulted in the taking of his property without due process. The\\n United States Supreme Court held that “when mailed notice of a tax\\n sale is returned unclaimed, the State must take additional\\n reasonable steps to attempt to provide notice to the property owner\\n before selling his property, if it is practicable to do so.” Id.\\n at 225, 164 L. Ed. 2d at 425. The Court reasoned that “despite the\\n fact that the letters were reasonably calculated to reach their\\n intended recipients when delivered to the postman[,]” id. at 229,\\n 164 L. Ed. 2d at 428, when the notice provider becomes aware that\\n normal procedures are ineffective in providing notice, this\\n triggers an obligation “to take additional steps to effect notice.”\\n Id. at 230, 164 L. Ed. 2d at 428. The Court then determined that\\n -13-\\n “[u]nder the circumstances presented [], additional reasonable\\n steps were available to the State.” Id. at 225, 164 L. Ed. 2d at\\n 425.\\n As in Flowers, the Sheriff in this case sent notice of the\\n pending property sale to Defendant through the United States Postal\\n Service via registered letter. However, unlike in Flowers where\\n the unclaimed letters were returned before the sale of the property\\n at issue, triggering the state’s obligation “to take additional\\n steps to effect notice” before the sale of the property, id., in\\n this case, the unclaimed letter was returned almost two months\\n after the execution sale of the condominium, and one month after\\n the Sheriff’s Deed was recorded. Thus, similar to Dusenbery and\\n Mullane where the government heard nothing back indicating that\\n their attempts at notice had gone awry, the Sheriff did not become\\n aware that the normal procedures for providing notice were\\n ineffective until after the sale had been finalized. Here, as in\\n Flowers, the letter was reasonably calculated to reach Defendant\\n when it was delivered to the postman, but, unlike Flowers, under\\n the circumstances presented in this case, it was not practicable\\n for the Sheriff, without knowledge of the non-receipt, to take\\n additional reasonable steps to notify Defendant of the impending\\n sale of the property.\\n Accordingly, the notice provided to Defendant complied with\\n due process requirements. The use of the mail addressed to\\n Defendant at his last known and actual address was clearly\\n acceptable for much the same reason the United States Supreme Court\\n -14-\\n and the North Carolina Appellate Courts have approved mailed notice\\n in the past. Dusenbery, 534 U.S. 161, 151 L. Ed. 2d 597. E.g.,\\n Henderson Cty. v.

Divorce--equitable distribution--property contract--affirmative defense catchall\\n provision\\n The trial court erred in a divorce case by disregarding a property contract on the basis\\n that it must have been pled as an affirmative defense under the catchall provision in N.C.G.S. §\\n 8C-1, Rule 8(c) because: (1) the contract governing property is not an affirmative defense, but\\n instead was a piece of evidence to be considered in settling the action for equitable distribution;\\n (2) no counterclaim was brought by defendant to which an affirmative defense would need to be\\n made; (3) it would not have been appropriate for plaintiff to specifically plead an affirmative\\n defense when defendant neither disputed the property contract nor brought any new claim of his\\n own; and (4) the trial court cited to neither statutory nor case law to support its holding, and the\\n Court of Appeals found none.\\n 3. Divorce--equitable distribution--validity of property contract--findings of fact\\n A divorce case is remanded to the trial court so that the validity of the property contract\\n and any other evidence as to equitable distribution may be considered because: (1) the trial court\\n made no findings of fact in any of its orders as to the validity of the property contract; and (2) the\\n record reflected no evidence on the question.\\n Appeal by plaintiff from orders entered 26 September 2005, 23\\n August 2006, and 22 August 2007 by Judge Mike Gentry in Person\\n County District Court. Heard in the Court of Appeals 14 May 2008.\\n Manning, Fulton & Skinner, P.A., by Michael S. Harrell, for\\n plaintiff-appellant.\\n No brief for defendant-appellee.\\n HUNTER, Judge.\\n -2-\\n Eula P. Street (“plaintiff”) appeals from three orders\\n pertaining to her divorce from Basil W. Street (“defendant”).\\n After careful review, we reverse and grant a new trial.\\n Plaintiff and defendant married in 1985. In 1989, the parties\\n entered into a contract (“the property contract”) stating that each\\n party “release[d], renounce[d], and quitclaim[ed] all interest in\\n any real property hereafter acquired by [other party].” The\\n parties separated in 1997 and were divorced in 1999. Equitable\\n distribution proceedings were then instigated.\\n In 2005, plaintiff moved for summary judgment on her claim for\\n equitable distribution. That motion was denied on 26 September\\n 2005; that order is one of the three from which plaintiff appeals.\\n On 23 August 2006, the court filed an order holding that the\\n property contract constituted an “affirmative defense” and\\n therefore “should have been specifically pled by Plaintiff.”\\n Because it was not, the trial court classified the parties’ former\\n home as marital property for purposes of equitable distribution.\\n This is the second order from which plaintiff appeals.\\n A final equitable distribution order was filed on 22 August\\n 2007. Therein, plaintiff was ordered to pay defendant $14,500.00\\n -- half the total equity the couple had in the marital home -- “for\\n his interest in the marital property of the parties[.]” This is\\n the final order from which plaintiff appeals.\\n [1] As to plaintiff’s arguments regarding the order denying\\n plaintiff’s claim for summary judgment, we note only that “[t]his\\n Court cannot consider an appeal of denial of the summary judgment\\n -3-\\n motion now that a final judgment on the merits has been made[.]”\\n WRI/Raleigh, L.P. v. Shaikh, 183 N.C. App. 249, 252, 644 S.E.2d\\n 245, 246 (2007). We therefore do not consider plaintiff’s\\n arguments as to that order.\\n As to the other two orders, plaintiff’s argument in essence is\\n that the court erred in (1) holding that the property contract must\\n have been pled as an affirmative defense and (2) refusing to give\\n the property contract effect on that basis. Because we agree with\\n the first, we do not address the second.\\n [2] In its August 2006 order holding that the property\\n contract must have been pled as an affirmative defense, the court\\n states that the contract was “improperly and untimely filed”\\n because it was “an affirmative defense within the meaning of Rule\\n 8(c) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure such that it\\n should have been specifically pled by Plaintiff.” [R p. 51] Rule\\n 8(c) lists twenty-one specific affirmative defenses that must be\\n pled, none of which apply in this case. N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1A-1,\\n Rule 8(c) (2007). Following this list is the following catch-all:\\n “[A]ny other matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative\\n defense.” Id. There are two errors in the trial court’s\\n conclusion that this catch-all applies to the property contract at\\n issue in this case. First, the contract governing property is not\\n an affirmative defense; rather, it is a piece of evidence to be\\n considered in settling the action for equitable distribution.\\n Second, and more important, no counterclaim was brought by\\n defendant to which an affirmative defense would need to be made.\\n -4-\\n Plaintiff brought an action for equitable distribution, and\\n defendant filed an answer admitting almost all of plaintiff’s\\n allegations and asking only for visitation and “such orders of\\n equitable distribution as is [sic] appropriate.” He neither\\n disputed the property contract nor brought any new claim of his\\n own. As such, it would not have been appropriate for plaintiff to\\n specifically plead an affirmative defense.\\n This appears to be the only basis on which the trial court\\n disregarded the property contract -- that is, that the property\\n contract was not timely filed because it was an affirmative\\n defense. The trial court cited only to Rule 8(c) in support of\\n this holding, and as discussed above, that rule does not apply.\\n The trial court cited to neither statutory nor case law to support\\n the holding, and this Court has found none. Thus, the property\\n contract was improperly disregarded by the trial court.\\n [3] The next question, then, is whether the property contract\\n is valid. We cannot make such a determination on the record before\\n us; the trial court made no findings of fact in any of its orders\\n as to the validity of the property contract, and the record\\n reflects no evidence on the question. As such, we remand this case\\n to the trial court so that the validity of the property contract --\\n and any other evidence as to equitable distribution -- may be\\n considered.\\n Reversed; new trial.\\n Judges STEELMAN and STEPHENS concur.\"\"\"\n",

The dispositive\\n question before this Court is whether the trial court erred in\\n granting defendant’s motion for summary judgment. For the\\n following reasons, we affirm.\\n I. Background\\n On 27 February 2007, plaintiff Eagle Engineering, Inc.\\n (“Eagle”) filed a complaint against defendant Continental Casualty\\n Company (“Continental”). Plaintiff alleged the following in the\\n complaint:\\n -2-\\n 7. Eagle purchased from Defendant a\\n Professional Liability and Pollution Incident\\n Liability Insurance Policy (“the Coverage\\n Agreement”) with policy number 11-405-03-06.\\n The policy period for the Coverage Agreement\\n was December 1, 2001, through December 1,\\n 2004.\\n 8. The Coverage Agreement provides, in\\n pertinent part:\\n A. We will pay all amounts in excess of\\n the deductible up to the limit of liability\\n that you become legally obligated to pay as a\\n result of:\\n 1. a wrongful act; or\\n 2. a pollution incident arising\\n out of your activities or the activities of\\n any person or entity for whom you are liable,\\n that results in a claim anywhere in the world,\\n provided that on the knowledge date set forth\\n on the Declarations no officer, director,\\n principal, partner or insurance manager knew\\n or could reasonably have expected that a claim\\n would be made.\\n B. A claim arising out of a wrongful\\n act or pollution incident must be first made\\n during the policy year or any applicable\\n extended reporting period. A claim is\\n considered first made when you receive notice\\n of the claim or as set forth in accordance\\n with Section VI. CONDITIONS, Item C., Your\\n Rights and Duties in the Event of a\\n Circumstance.\\n 9. The Coverage Agreement also includes the\\n following descriptive language of the type of\\n coverage provided:\\n Your professional liability and pollution\\n incident liability insurance policy is written\\n on a “claims-made” basis and applies only to\\n those claims first made against you while this\\n insurance is in force. No coverage exists for\\n claims first made against you after the end of\\n the policy term unless, and to the extent, an\\n extended reporting period applies.\\n 10. Shea Homes, LLC (“Shea”), is a\\n residential home builder that does business\\n throughout North Carolina.\\n -3-\\n 11. Shea filed counterclaims against Eagle in\\n Union County Superior Court Case No. 03-CVS-\\n 02057 on March 8, 2004, which were amended\\n August 9, 2004. The gravamen of Shea’s\\n counterclaims was that Eagle had improperly\\n performed professional services in a Shea\\n development and that this had led to property\\n damage.\\n 12. Eagle purchased similar insurance\\n coverage from Defendant for the period from\\n January 4, 2006, through January 4, 2007. The\\n coverage language is identical to that set\\n forth in the Coverage Agreement. Eagle was\\n insured with a different carrier for the\\n intervening period.\\n 13. Eagle listed Shea’s counterclaims as a\\n pending lawsuit in its application for the\\n 2006 policy year. Defendant accepted the\\n business, and Eagle’s premium.\\n 14. Eagle began to ask Defendant to assume\\n the defense and indemnification obligations\\n surrounding Shea’s counterclaims as early as\\n November, 2005.\\n 15. Defendant refused, contending that the\\n Coverage Agreement required notice to be\\n received during a policy year in order to\\n trigger coverage.\\n 16. Eagle resolved Shea’s counterclaims on\\n the eve of trial after failing to convince\\n Defendant to indemnify against the\\n counterclaims or even pick up the defense.\\n Plaintiff brought a cause of action against defendant for breach of\\n contract.\\n On or about 9 May 2007, defendant filed an answer. On or\\n about 17 August 2007, defendant filed a motion for summary\\n judgment. An affidavit from James F. Alderson (“Alderson”), a\\n claims consultant with Continental, referred to Exhibits A and B,\\n Policy Declarations. Exhibit A is “[a] true and accurate copy of\\n [the 11-405-03-06] policy” which ran from 1 December 2001 through\\n -4-\\n 1 December 2004. Exhibit B is “[a] true and accurate copy of [the\\n 27-620-29-33] policy” which ran from 4 January 2006 through 4\\n January 2007. Within Exhibit B is a “Conditions” section. This\\n section provides,\\n B. Your Duties If There Is A Claim\\n If there is a claim, you must do the\\n following:\\n 1. promptly notify us in writing.\\n . . .\\n The notice must be given to us within a\\n policy year or within 60 days after its\\n expiration or termination[.]\\n . . . .\\n N. Extended Reporting Period\\n 1. Automatic Extended Reporting Period\\n If this Policy is canceled or nonrenewed\\n by either us or by the first Named\\n Insured, we will provide an automatic, noncancelable\\n extended reporting period starting\\n at the termination of the policy term if the\\n first Named Insured has not obtained similar\\n coverage. This automatic extended reporting\\n period will terminate after 60 days.\\n 2. Optional Extended Reporting Period\\n If this Policy is canceled or nonrenewed\\n by either us or by the first Named\\n Insured, then the first Named Insured shall\\n have the right to purchase an optional\\n extended reporting period. Such right must be\\n exercised by the first Named Insured within 60\\n days of the termination of the policy term[.]\\n . . . .\\n 4. Extended Reporting Period\\n Limitations\\n No additional or optional extended\\n reporting period shall apply to:\\n a. any claim or proceedings\\n pending at the inception date of such extended\\n reporting period[.]\\n The affidavit further provided,\\n -5-\\n 5. Continental Casualty Company did not\\n provide insurance to Eagle Engineering, Inc.\\n from January 4, 2005 through January 4, 2006.\\n . . . .\\n 9. From the information provided to the\\n Continental Casualty Company by Eagle\\n Engineering, Inc., the date of the claim for\\n which Eagle Engineering seeks indemnification\\n and a defense in this litigation was August 9,\\n 2004. Notice of this claim was not submitted\\n to CNA and Continental Casualty Company until\\n October 5, 2006.\\n On 20 September 2007, S. Stephen Goodwin, Jr., trial counsel\\n for Eagle Engineering in the case with Shea, filed an affidavit\\n which stated, “Any delays on Eagles part were either inadvertent or\\n the result of difficulty obtaining information.” On this same date\\n Frank L. “Skeet” Gray, III, P.E., a principle [sic] with plaintiff,\\n also filed an affidavit stating, “[T]here was absolutely no\\n purposeful intentional or deliberate decision by Eagle Engineering\\n to delay notification to the Defendant.”\\n On 30 October 2007, the trial court granted defendant’s motion\\n for summary judgment because “there is no genuine issue as to any\\n material fact that plaintiff did not provide notice of the claim\\n within the policy period or within 60 days after the expiration of\\n the policy period.” Plaintiff appeals. The dispositive question\\n before this Court is whether the trial court erred in granting\\n defendant’s motion for summary judgment. For the following\\n reasons, we affirm.\\n II. Summary Judgment\\n Plaintiff argues that the trial court erred by granting\\n summary judgment in favor of defendant. Plaintiff contends that\\n -6-\\n Continental’s position centers on its\\n contention that the Policy at issue is a\\n “claims made,” rather than an occurrence\\n policy. Continental’s duties, then, depend on\\n the definition of “claims made.” A claims\\n made policy generally restricts coverage to\\n those claims which are made against the\\n insured during the policy period. . . . A pure\\n claims-made policy allows a claim to be\\n presented after the policy period has expired.\\n . . . A “claims made and reported” policy, on\\n the other hand, engrafts a second requirement\\n on to the definition of a covered claim. It\\n must be both made to the insured and reported\\n to the carrier within the policy period.\\n In Digh v. Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co. this Court stated,\\n Summary judgment is appropriate if the\\n pleadings, depositions, answers to\\n interrogatories, and admissions on file,\\n together with the affidavits, if any, show\\n that there is no genuine issue as to any\\n material fact and that a party is entitled to\\n a judgment as a matter of law. On appeal of a\\n trial court's allowance of a motion for\\n summary judgment, we consider whether, on the\\n basis of materials supplied to the trial\\n court, there was a genuine issue of material\\n fact and whether the moving party is entitled\\n to judgment as a matter of law. Evidence\\n presented by the parties is viewed in the\\n light most favorable to the non-movant.\\n We begin by noting that insurance\\n policies are considered contracts between two\\n parties. It is the duty of the court to\\n construe an insurance policy as it is written,\\n not to rewrite it and thus make a new contract\\n for the parties. Insurance contracts are\\n construed according to the intent of the\\n parties, and in the absence of ambiguity, we\\n construe them by the plain, ordinary and\\n accepted meaning of the language used.\\n Digh v. Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 187 N.C. App. 725, 727-28,\\n 654 S.E.2d 37, 39 (2007) (internal citations, internal quotation\\n marks, brackets, and heading omitted). Furthermore,\\n a mere disagreement between the parties over\\n the language of the insurance contract does\\n -7-\\n not create an ambiguity. Rather, no ambiguity\\n exists unless, in the opinion of the court,\\n the language of the policy is fairly and\\n reasonably susceptible to either of the\\n constructions for which the parties contend.\\n Also, each provision of an insurance contract\\n must be interpreted in view of the whole\\n contract and not in isolation.\\n Pennsylvania Nat.’l Mut. Ins. Co. v. Strickland, 178 N.C. App. 547,\\n 550, 631 S.E.2d 845, 847 (2006) (internal citations, internal\\n quotation marks, ellipses, and brackets omitted).\\n Both Exhibit A, policy term of 1 December 2001 through 1\\n December 2004 (“hereinafter “Policy 1\"), and Exhibit B, policy term\\n of 4 January 2006 through 4 January 2007, (hereinafter “Policy 2\")\\n refer to the attached “Professional Liability Policy.” The\\n Professional Liability Policy provides in bold capitalized font at\\n the top of the policy,\\n Your professional liability and pollution\\n incident liability insurance policy is written\\n on a “claims-made” basis and applies only to\\n those claims first made against you while this\\n insurance is in force. No coverage exists for\\n claims first made against you after the end of\\n the policy term unless, and to the extent, an\\n extended reporting period applies.\\n The Professional Liability Policy further provides that notice of\\n a claim “must be given . . . within a policy year or within 60 days\\n after its expiration or termination.” Thus, the Professional\\n Liability Policy requires plaintiff’s claim to have both arisen\\n during a covered policy term and to be reported within a covered\\n policy term or within 60 days thereafter.\\n The exact date defendant was informed of plaintiff’s claim is\\n in contention, but was somewhere between November 2005 and October\\n -8-\\n 2006. Plaintiff, however, contends, defendant was informed of the\\n claim in November of 2005, and we will view the evidence in a light\\n most favorable to plaintiff, the non-movant. See Dighat 727-28,\\n 654 S.E.2d at 39.\\n A. Policy 1\\n As to Policy 1, neither November 2005 nor October 2006 falls\\n within the policy term of 1 December 2001 through 1 December 2004\\n nor within 60 days thereafter. Therefore, pursuant to the plain\\n language of the policy, Policy 1 does not provide coverage for\\n plaintiff’s claim.\\n B. Policy 2\\n As to Policy 2, Shea filed its counterclaims against plaintiff\\n on 8 March 2004 and amended those claims 9 August 2004; 8 March\\n 2004 and 9 August 2004 are not dates during which the 4 January\\n 2006 through 4 January 2007 policy would have been “in force.”\\n Therefore, Policy 2 does not provide coverage for plaintiff’s\\n claim.\\n C. Policies 1 and 2\\n Viewing the contracts as a whole it is plain that plaintiff’s\\n claim must have arisen during a covered policy period and plaintiff\\n was required to make its claim within a covered policy period or 60\\n days thereafter, which plaintiff failed to do. See Digh at 727-28,\\n 654 S.E.2d at 39; Pennsylvania Nat.’l Mut. Ins. Co. at 550, 631\\n S.E.2d at 847 (2006). There is no ambiguity within the policy nor\\n any merit to plaintiff’s argument, and therefore this argument is\\n overruled.\\n -9-\\n D. Prejudice\\n Furthermore, plaintiff contends that there are “genuine issues\\n of material fact . . . as to whether defendant was prejudiced by\\n the timing of the notice in this case.” However, prejudice is\\n irrelevant in light of the fact that the parties have a plain\\n unambiguous contract setting out the terms of the agreement on this\\n issue. See Digh at 727-28, 654 S.E.2d at 39; Pennsylvania Nat.’l\\n Mut. Ins. Co. at 550, 631 S.E.2d at 847 (2006). This argument is\\n without merit.\\n III. Conclusion\\n For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the trial court’s\\n granting of defendant’s motion for summary judgment.\\n AFFIRMED.\\n Judges McCULLOUGH and TYSON concur.\"\"\"\n",

App. at 350,\\n 517 S.E.2d at 399. Plaintiff’s notice of hearing was adequate and\\n proper in light of Rule 56(c) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil\\n Procedure. This assignment of error is overruled.\\n V. Service of Process\\n [2] Defendant argues the district court lacked subject matter\\n and personal jurisdiction because she was not properly served with\\n the summons and complaint prior to the trial court’s entry of\\n absolute divorce. We disagree.\\n A. Subject Matter Jurisdiction\\n “The district court division is the proper division without\\n regard to the amount in controversy, for the trial of civil actions\\n and proceedings for . . . divorce . . . .” N.C. Gen. Stat. §\\n 7A-244 (2005). “In North Carolina, subject matter jurisdiction for\\n divorce involves not only bringing the matter in the correct court,\\n but also the court’s finding residence by one of the parties for\\n -5-\\n the requisite length of time and verification of the pleadings.”\\n 2 Suzanne Reynolds, Lee’s North Carolina Family Law § 7.25, at 88\\n (5th ed. 1999) (citations omitted); see also N.C. Gen. Stat. §§\\n 50-6, -8 (2005).\\n Here, plaintiff filed a verified complaint with the\\n Mecklenburg County District Court. The district court found: (1)\\n “[p]laintiff has been a citizen and resident of the State of North\\n Carolina for more than six months next preceding the institution of\\n this action[]” and (2) “[p]laintiff and [d]efendant have lived\\n separate and apart for more than one year next preceding the\\n institution of this action without resuming the marital\\n relationship.” The district court’s findings are supported by\\n plaintiff’s verified complaint, which may be treated as an\\n affidavit. See Page v. Sloan, 281 N.C. 697, 705, 190 S.E.2d 189,\\n 194 (1972) (“A verified complaint may be treated as an affidavit if\\n it (1) is made on personal knowledge, (2) sets forth such facts as\\n would be admissible in evidence, and (3) shows affirmatively that\\n the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein.”\\n Citations omitted)).\\n The district court properly exercised jurisdiction over the\\n subject matter of the parties’ divorce action.

Stat. § 1-75.10 (2007) (emphasis supplied).\\n Here, plaintiff filed an affidavit of service by certified\\n mail on 7 June 2007. The affidavit stated that “copies of a Civil\\n Summons and Complaint were deposited in the U.S. Post Office for\\n -7-\\n mailing by certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to\\n [defendant] . . . .” Attached to plaintiff’s affidavit was: (1)\\n a receipt for certified mail which showed item number 7160 3901\\n 9848 8335 2054 was mailed on 3 May 2007 and (2) a track/confirm\\n sheet from the U.S. Post Office which indicated item number 7160\\n 3901 9848 8335 2054 was delivered to and signed for by defendant on\\n 22 May 2007 at 11:36 a.m.\\n It is clear from plaintiff’s affidavit of service by certified\\n mail and attachments thereto with defendant’s signature appearing\\n thereon that the summons and complaint were personally served upon\\n defendant pursuant to Rule 4(j)(1)(c) of the North Carolina Rules\\n of Civil Procedure.\\n Our holding is also consistent with other jurisdictions, which\\n have held service to be sufficient when reviewing facts similar to\\n those at bar.

We affirm.\\n I. Background\\n Elm St. Gallery, Inc. is the owner of property located at 320\\n South Elm Street, Greensboro, North Carolina (“plaintiffs’\\n building”). Defendants formerly owned property located at 324\\n South Elm Street (“defendants’ building”), which adjoined\\n plaintiffs’ building by a shared party wall. On 24 October 2003,\\n a fire occurred in defendants’ unoccupied building.\\n At the time of the fire, William and Anna Heroy owned a\\n photography business located on the first floor of plaintiffs’\\n building. The second and third floors of plaintiffs’ building were\\n rented as residential apartments. As a result of the fire,\\n plaintiffs’ building sustained damage and the photography business\\n and residential tenants were required to vacate the premises.\\n Plaintiffs commenced repairs and renovations to the party wall\\n and to their building. Plaintiffs demanded defendants demolish the\\n remnants of their building to facilitate plaintiffs’ repairs.\\n Defendants allegedly expressed an intent to comply with plaintiffs’\\n requests, but failed to do so.\\n Due to defendants’ inaction in demolishing the remnants of\\n their building, the City of Greensboro issued a demolition order.\\n -3-\\n On 21 February 2005, defendants sold their property to a third\\n party, who subsequently demolished the building.\\n On 13 June 2006, plaintiffs filed an unverified complaint and\\n alleged defendants had negligently maintained their building in\\n such a condition that caused or contributed to the start and spread\\n of the fire. On 16 June 2006, plaintiffs’ filed an amended\\n complaint and further alleged defendants negligently delayed taking\\n corrective action to remedy the condition of their building after\\n the fire. Defendants filed an answer, denied all of plaintiffs’\\n allegations, and raised the affirmative defenses of: (1)\\n contributory negligence; (2) res judicata; and (3) failure to\\n mitigate damages.\\n On 26 April 2007, defendants moved for summary judgment on all\\n of plaintiffs’ claims. Plaintiffs also filed a motion for summary\\n judgment regarding defendants’ counterclaim. However, no\\n counterclaim was asserted in defendants’ original answer and no\\n amended answer is included as part of the record on appeal.\\n The trial court granted plaintiffs’ motion for summary\\n judgment regarding defendants’ counterclaim. The trial court also\\n granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment on all of\\n plaintiffs’ claims contained in their amended complaint.\\n Plaintiffs appeal.\\n II. Issues\\n Plaintiffs argue genuine issues of material fact exist and the\\n trial court erred by granting defendants’ motion for summary\\n judgment.\\n -4-\\n III. Summary Judgment\\n Plaintiffs argue the trial court erred by granting defendants’\\n motion for summary judgment because genuine issues of material fact\\n exist regarding: (1) the cause of the fire and (2) whether\\n defendants negligently delayed taking corrective action to remedy\\n the condition of their building after the fire occurred. We\\n disagree.\\n A. Standard of Review\\n Summary judgment is proper if the pleadings,\\n depositions, answers to interrogatories, and\\n admissions on file, together with the\\n affidavits, if any, show that there is no\\n genuine issue as to any material fact and that\\n any party is entitled to a judgment as a\\n matter of law. The party moving for summary\\n judgment ultimately has the burden of\\n establishing the lack of any triable issue of\\n fact.\\n A defendant may show entitlement to summary\\n judgment by (1) proving that an essential\\n element of the plaintiff’s case is\\n non-existent, or (2) showing through discovery\\n that the plaintiff cannot produce evidence to\\n support an essential element of his of her\\n claim, or (3) showing that the plaintiff\\n cannot surmount an affirmative defense.\\n Summary judgment is not appropriate where\\n matters of credibility and determining the\\n weight of the evidence exist.\\n Once the party seeking summary judgment makes\\n the required showing, the burden shifts to the\\n nonmoving party to produce a forecast of\\n evidence demonstrating specific facts, as\\n opposed to allegations, showing that he can at\\n least establish a prima facie case at trial.\\n We review an order allowing summary judgment\\n de novo. If the granting of summary judgment\\n can be sustained on any grounds, it should be\\n affirmed on appeal.\\n -5-\\n Wilkins v. Safran, 185 N.C. App. 668, 672, 649 S.E.2d 658, 661\\n (2007) (internal citations and quotations omitted).\\n B. Analysis\\n Our Supreme Court has “emphasized that summary judgment is a\\n drastic measure, and it should be used with caution[,]” especially\\n in negligence cases in which a jury ordinarily applies a reasonable\\n person standard to the facts of each case. Williams v. Power &\\n Light Co., 296 N.C. 400, 402, 250 S.E.2d 255, 257 (1979) (citation\\n omitted). Summary judgment has been held to be proper in\\n negligence cases “where the evidence fails to show negligence on\\n the part of defendant, or where contributory negligence on the part\\n of plaintiff is established, or where it is established that the\\n purported negligence of defendant was not the proximate cause of\\n plaintiff’s injury.” Hale v. Power Co., 40 N.C. App. 202, 203, 252\\n S.E.2d 265, 267 (citation omitted), cert. denied, 297 N.C. 452, 256\\n S.E.2d 805 (1979).\\n 1. Causation\\n [1] Our Supreme Court has addressed the issue of causation in\\n several cases that involve negligence actions arising from fire\\n damage. See Snow v. Power Co., 297 N.C. 591, 256 S.E.2d 227\\n (1979); Phelps v. Winston-Salem, 272 N.C. 24, 157 S.E.2d 719\\n (1967); Maharias v. Storage Co., 257 N.C. 767, 127 S.E.2d 548\\n (1962). In both Maharias and Phelps, our Supreme Court affirmed\\n judgments, which dismissed the plaintiffs’ negligence claims based\\n upon a lack of evidence tending to show a causal link between the\\n defendants’ alleged negligence and the origin of the fire. 257\\n -6-\\n N.C. at 767-68, 127 S.E.2d at 549; 272 N.C. at 24, 157 S.E.2d at\\n 719.\\n In Maharias, a fire originated at the defendant’s warehouse\\n and caused significant damage to the plaintiff’s adjacent\\n restaurant and the contents within. 257 N.C. at 767, 127 S.E.2d at\\n 549. An Assistant Fire Chief inspected the defendant’s building\\n and opined that it was possible the fire had been caused by\\n spontaneous combustion of a pile of furniture-polishing rags, but\\n that “[the] fire could have happened from any one of a number of\\n causes.” Id. Our Supreme Court held that non-suit entered at the\\n close of the plaintiff’s evidence was proper because “[t]he\\n evidence raised a mere conjecture, surmise and speculation as to\\n the cause of the fire.” Id. at 768, 127 S.E.2d at 549. Our\\n Supreme Court further stated, “[a] cause of action must be based on\\n something more than a guess.” Id.\\n In Phelps, the plaintiffs were tenants in a building owned and\\n operated by the City of Winston-Salem. 272 N.C. at 25, 157 S.E.2d\\n at 720. A fire originated in the defendant’s building and\\n destroyed a substantial amount of the plaintiffs’ belongings. Id.\\n at 26, 157 S.E.2d at 720. The plaintiffs alleged the defendant had\\n negligently allowed combustible materials to accumulate in the\\n building and had failed to provide fire safety equipment. Id. at\\n 26, 157 S.E.2d at 721. The fire chief and the captain in charge of\\n the Fire Prevention Bureau both testified they were unable to\\n determine the cause of the fire. Id. at 27, 157 S.E.2d at 721.\\n -7-\\n Applying the reasoning in Maharias, our Supreme Court held that the\\n cause of the fire was “unexplained” and stated:\\n [p]roof of the burning alone is not sufficient\\n to establish liability, for if nothing more\\n appears, the presumption is that the fire was\\n the result of accident or some providential\\n cause. There can be no liability without\\n satisfactory proof, by either direct or\\n circumstantial evidence, not only of the\\n burning of the property in question but that\\n it was the proximate result of negligence and\\n did not result from natural or accidental\\n causes.\\n Id. at 31, 157 S.E.2d at 724 (citation omitted). Our Supreme Court\\n further stated that the plaintiff bears the burden to\\n “affirmatively fix [responsibility] upon the defendant by the\\n greater weight of the evidence.” Id. at 28, 157 S.E.2d at 722.\\n Several years later in Snow, our Supreme Court limited the\\n holdings in Maharias and Phelps to the particular facts presented\\n in both cases and acknowledged that the circumstances in Snow\\n presented a “very different factual context.” 297 N.C. at 598, 256\\n S.E.2d at 232. In Snow, the plaintiffs filed a negligence action\\n against Duke Power Company and alleged a fire originated at a\\n faulty electrical meter attached to a barn. Id. at 597, 256 S.E.2d\\n at 232. The plaintiffs presented evidence tending to show:\\n (1) that the fire originated at a point where\\n the wiring connecting the weatherhead to the\\n meter box was “hot” with electrical current;\\n (2) that the initially compact and\\n concentrated nature of the flames was\\n consistent with an electrical fire; [and] (3)\\n that the fire took some time to spread from\\n the front of the barn -- where the “hot wires”\\n were located -- to the back of the barn.\\n -8-\\n Id. at 598, 256 S.E.2d at 232. The plaintiffs also presented\\n evidence which tended to negate the likelihood of other causes of\\n the fire. Id.\\n Our Supreme Court affirmed the trial court’s denial of the\\n defendant’s motion for a directed verdict on the theory of res ipsa\\n loquitur and stated “[i]f the facts proven establish the more\\n reasonable probability that the fire was electrical in origin, then\\n the case cannot be withdrawn from the jury though all possible\\n causes have not been eliminated.” Id. at 597, 256 S.E.2d at 232.\\n Plaintiffs argue that Snow is “controlling.” We disagree and\\n find the factual backgrounds and analyses presented in Maharias and\\n Phelps to be directly on point with the facts at bar.\\n Here, Greensboro Fire Department Inspector Myron E. Kenan\\n (“Inspector Kenan”) arrived at the scene of the fire and observed\\n the building fully engulfed in flames. After the fire was\\n extinguished, the building was deemed unsafe to enter. An\\n investigation could not be immediately completed to determine the\\n cause or origin of the fire. A month later, on 25 November 2003,\\n Inspector Kenan returned to the site and conducted his\\n investigation. Inspector Kenan discovered a portion of the second\\n floor was severely damaged and opined that the fire had originated\\n in the right rear corner of that floor. Further investigation\\n revealed “three generations of electrical wiring design” within the\\n building.\\n Inspector Kenan photographed and examined all of the\\n electrical panels located in the vicinity of the damaged portion of\\n -9-\\n the second floor. Inspector Kenan’s report specifically stated\\n that he “did not find any prevalent indications of an electrical\\n cause of the fire. However, with the extent of fire damage [he]\\n [could not] determine that this fire was not electrical in nature.”\\n Another member of the investigation team, “who ha[d] extensive\\n knowledge of electrical service and equipment[,]” agreed with\\n Inspector Kenan’s findings. The fire investigation report further\\n stated, “In addition to not being able to deduct all possible\\n accidental causes[,] I cannot make a determination that this fire\\n was or was not incendiary in nature.” The cause of the fire was\\n ultimately listed as “undetermined.”\\n Although our Supreme Court has acknowledged that “the origin\\n of a fire may be established by circumstantial evidence[,]” it has\\n also stated, “[w]hether the circumstantial evidence is sufficient\\n to take the case out of the realm of conjecture and into the field\\n of legitimate inference from established facts, must be determined\\n in relation to the attendant facts and circumstances of each case.”\\n Snow, 297 N.C. at 597, 256 S.E.2d at 232 (citations and quotations\\n omitted). Here, plaintiffs’ assertion that the evidence points to\\n “an electrical fire originating from the right rear of\\n [d]efendants’ building” is “a mere conjecture, surmise and\\n speculation as to the cause of the fire.” Maharias, 257 N.C. at\\n 768, 127 S.E.2d at 549.\\n The record is completely devoid of any evidence tending to\\n support plaintiffs’ assertion. Inspector Kenan and two other\\n experts were unable to determine the origin of the fire.\\n -10-\\n Plaintiffs’ unsubstantiated and self-serving allegation that\\n immediately prior to the fire, defendants’ rear gutters could have\\n allowed water to come into contact with electrical wiring is\\n insufficient to submit the issue of defendants’ negligence to the\\n jury. See Phelps, 272 N.C. at 31, 157 S.E.2d at 724 (“In order to\\n go to the jury on the question of defendant’s negligence causing\\n the fire, plaintiffs must not only show that the fire might have\\n been started due to the defendant’s negligence, but must show by\\n reasonable affirmative evidence that it did so originate.”\\n (Emphasis original)).\\n Plaintiffs have failed to establish any inference that the\\n alleged negligence by defendants was the actual or proximate cause\\n of their injury. Because “[a] cause of action must be based on\\n something more than a guess[,]” the trial court properly granted\\n defendants’ motion for summary judgment regarding this issue.\\n Maharias, 257 N.C. at 768, 127 S.E.2d at 549. This assignment of\\n error is overruled.\\n 2. Corrective Action\\n [2] Plaintiffs also argue genuine issues of material fact\\n exist regarding whether defendants negligently delayed taking\\n corrective action to remedy the condition of their building after\\n the fire occurred. Plaintiffs assert “water was seeping into\\n Plaintiffs’ property on account of Defendants’ failure to demolish\\n or repair what remained of their building[,]” which impeded repairs\\n to the first floor of plaintiffs’ building and caused a loss of\\n potential rental income.\\n -11-\\n “In order to prevail in a negligence action, plaintiffs must\\n offer evidence of the essential elements of negligence: duty,\\n breach of duty, proximate cause, and damages.” Camalier v.\\n Jeffries, 340 N.C. 699, 706, 460 S.E.2d 133, 136 (1995) (citation\\n omitted). Presuming arguendo, that plaintiffs could establish a\\n duty and breach thereof, plaintiffs have once again failed to\\n produce any evidence tending to show or to raise any inference that\\n defendants’ alleged negligence was the proximate cause of\\n plaintiffs’ injury.\\n It is a well established principle that “all damages must flow\\n directly and naturally from the wrong, and that they must be\\n certain both in their nature and in respect to the cause from which\\n they proceed.” People’s Center, Inc. v. Anderson, 32 N.C. App.\\n 746, 748, 233 S.E.2d 694, 696 (1977) (citation omitted) (emphasis\\n supplied). “[N]o recovery is allowed when resort to speculation or\\n conjecture is necessary to determine whether the damage resulted\\n from the unlawful act of which complaint is made or from some other\\n source.” Id. at 748-49, 233 S.E.2d at 696 (citation omitted).\\n During William Heroy’s deposition he testified, “[a]ccording\\n [to] the inspector, the water intrusion from [defendants’] existing\\n building there penetrated the walls top to bottom.” Plaintiffs’\\n attorney also wrote a letter to defendants that asserted the\\n condition of defendants’ building after the fire was “allowing\\n water runoff onto the property at 320 S. Elm Street[.]”\\n Plaintiffs have presented no evidence to support these\\n allegations. The record on appeal contains no sworn affidavit from\\n -12-\\n plaintiffs’ supposed inspector nor any inspection report. The\\n record is also completely devoid of any other evidence that tends\\n to establish that defendants’ delay in demolishing and/or repairing\\n their building caused the moisture problems of which plaintiffs now\\n complain.\\n Further, William Heroy, perhaps unknowingly, contradicted his\\n earlier allegations by testifying that at the time of his\\n deposition, the “water intrusion” was continuing to impact\\n reconstruction even after the total demolition of defendants’\\n former building was completed. Viewing the evidence in the light\\n most favorable to plaintiffs, the trial court properly granted\\n defendants’ motion for summary judgment because speculation or\\n conjecture would be required to determine whether the damage to\\n plaintiffs’ building resulted from defendants’ delay in the\\n demolition, plaintiffs’ repairs to their building, or from some\\n other source. People’s Center, Inc., 32 N.C. App. at 748-49, 233\\n S.E.2d at 696.\\n Plaintiffs’ unsubstantiated and contradictory allegations are\\n insufficient to establish any inference that defendants’ alleged\\n negligence was the actual or proximate cause of plaintiffs’ injury.\\n The trial court properly entered summary judgment in favor of\\n defendants. This assignment of error is overruled.\\n IV. Conclusion\\n Plaintiffs failed to establish defendants’ purported\\n negligence, before or after the fire, provided a causal connection\\n to plaintiffs’ alleged damages. The trial court properly granted\\n -13-\\n defendants’ motion for summary judgment. The trial court’s order\\n is affirmed.\\n Affirmed.\\n Judges HUNTER and JACKSON concur.\"\"\"\n",

MILLS\\n Opinion of the Court\\n -2-\\n before exhausting the liability insurance policies of all the at-fault drivers. We\\n conclude that the insured is only required to exhaust the liability insurance\\n coverage of a single at-fault motorist in order to trigger the insurer’s obligation to\\n provide UIM benefits. Accordingly, we affirm the Court of Appeals’ decision on this\\n issue. Because, however, the trial court’s award of interest and costs against the\\n insurer in this case exceeds the amount the insurer contractually promised to pay\\n under the terms of its policy with the insured, the Court of Appeals erred in\\n upholding that portion of the award. In this respect, we reverse the Court of\\n Appeals.\\n Facts\\n The parties to this appeal have stipulated to the material facts, which tend to\\n establish that on 18 September 2009, defendant Thomas E. Mills was operating a\\n tractor-trailer owned by his employer, defendant James W. Crowder, III. Mills was\\n traveling eastbound on Interstate Highway 40 in McDowell County when he lost\\n control while rounding a curve, causing his vehicle to collide with the concrete\\n median barrier and flip. Plaintiff Douglas Kirk Lunsford, a volunteer firefighter,\\n responded first to the scene and found that Mills was injured and that diesel fuel\\n was leaking from the tractor-trailer. Lunsford, who was standing in the highway\\n median, attempted to lift Mills over the concrete divider so that he could carry Mills\\n to safety and assess his injuries. As Lunsford was doing so, defendant Shawn T.\\n Buchanan was driving westbound on Interstate Highway 40. When the vehicle in\\n LUNSFORD V. MILLS\\n Opinion of the Court\\n -3-\\n front of Buchanan slowed down because of the tractor-trailer accident, Buchanan\\n swerved to the left to avoid the vehicle and struck Lunsford. Lunsford was dragged\\n underneath Buchanan’s car and suffered severe injuries, including multiple broken\\n bones, lacerations, and internal injuries.\\n At the time of the accidents, Mills and Crowder were insured through\\n Crowder’s business motor vehicle policy with United States Fire Insurance\\n Company (U.S. Fire), which provided a liability coverage limit of $1 million. The\\n second driver, Buchanan, was insured under a policy written by Allstate Insurance\\n Company (Allstate), providing liability coverage of $50,000. Lunsford maintained\\n two policies with unnamed defendant North Carolina Farm Bureau Mutual\\n Insurance Company (Farm Bureau): (1) a business policy with UIM coverage of\\n $300,000; and (2) a personal policy with UIM coverage of $100,000.\\n Lunsford subsequently filed a negligence action against Mills, Crowder, and\\n Buchanan (named defendants), claiming that they were jointly and severally liable\\n for his injuries. All named defendants filed answers, which included crossclaims for\\n indemnification and contribution. Farm Bureau, as an unnamed defendant, also\\n filed an answer in which it claimed that it would be entitled to an offset with\\n respect to Lunsford’s UIM policies for any damages he recovered through the\\n insurance policies held by the named defendants.\\n LUNSFORD V. MILLS\\n Opinion of the Court\\n -4-\\n On 24 May 2011, Allstate tendered to Lunsford the $50,000 liability coverage\\n limit for Buchanan’s policy. Lunsford’s attorney notified Farm Bureau the next day\\n of Allstate’s tender and demanded that Farm Bureau tender payment on Lunsford’s\\n UIM claim. In a letter dated 7 June 2011, Farm Bureau indicated that (1) it would\\n not advance the liability policy limits tendered to Lunsford by Allstate; and (2) it\\n would review its legal options regarding Lunsford’s UIM claim and respond “at a\\n later date.” On 15 November 2011, Lunsford’s attorney informed Farm Bureau that\\n Lunsford had tentatively settled his claims against Mills and Crowder for $850,000,\\n which was to be paid through Crowder’s policy with U.S. Fire. At the time of these\\n settlements, Farm Bureau had not provided UIM coverage to Lunsford.\\n On 12 January 2012, the trial court entered an order approving the\\n settlement agreements. On 19 July 2012, Farm Bureau filed a motion for summary\\n judgment on Lunsford’s UIM claim, arguing that he was not entitled to UIM\\n coverage because the total amount of his settlements with Buchanan, Mills, and\\n Crowder ($50,000 + $850,000 = $900,000) exceeded the aggregate amount of\\n Lunsford’s UIM policies ($300,000 + $100,000 = $400,000). Lunsford also moved for\\n summary judgment, maintaining that his UIM policies stacked and that he was\\n entitled to recover $350,000 from Farm Bureau—the amount of his aggregated UIM\\n coverage limit ($400,000) minus the $50,000 he recovered through his settlement\\n with Buchanan.\\n LUNSFORD V. MILLS\\n Opinion of the Court\\n -5-\\n After conducting a hearing on the parties’ motions, the trial court entered an\\n order on 13 November 2012 granting summary judgment in favor of Lunsford. The\\n trial court accordingly ordered Farm Bureau to pay Lunsford $350,000, plus costs\\n and pre- and post-judgment interest “as provided by law.”\\n Farm Bureau appealed the trial court’s order to the Court of Appeals,\\n primarily arguing that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor\\n of Lunsford and ordering Farm Bureau to pay $350,000 in UIM coverage because,\\n under the statute governing UIM coverage, Farm Bureau “was not required to\\n provide coverage until all applicable policies—meaning all policies held by all the\\n named Defendants—had been exhausted.” Lunsford v. Mills, ___ N.C. App. ___,\\n ___, 747 S.E.2d 390, 393 (2013). The court disagreed based on its reading of the\\n UIM statute: “ ‘Underinsured motorist coverage is deemed to apply when, by\\n reason of payment of judgment or settlement, all liability bonds or insurance\\n policies providing coverage for bodily injury caused by the ownership, maintenance,\\n or use of the underinsured highway vehicle have been exhausted.’ ” Id. at ___, 747\\n S.E.2d at 393 (quoting N.C.G.S. § 20-279.21(b)(4) (emphasis added by court)). The\\n court interpreted this language “to mean that UIM coverage is triggered the\\n moment that an insured has recovered under all policies applicable to ‘a’—meaning\\n one—‘underinsured highway vehicle’ involved in a motor vehicle accident resulting\\n in injury to the insured.” Id. at ___, 747 S.E.2d at 393 (emphasis added).\\n LUNSFORD V. MILLS\\n Opinion of the Court\\n -6-\\n Noting that the issue of when UIM coverage is triggered in situations\\n involving multiple potential at-fault drivers is one of first impression in North\\n Carolina, the Court of Appeals believed that its interpretation of the UIM statute\\n was consistent with that court’s precedent suggesting that “insureds should [not] ‘be\\n kept hanging in limbo as they are forced to sue any and all possible persons . . .\\n before they could recover UIM benefits’ just because other potential tortfeasors also\\n happen to be covered under automobile policies.” Id. at ___, 747 S.E.2d at 394\\n (quoting Farm Bureau Ins. Co. of N.C. v. Blong, 159 N.C. App. 365, 373, 583 S.E.2d\\n 307, 312, disc. rev. denied, 357 N.C. 578, 589 S.E.2d 125 (2003)). In light of this\\n rationale, the court determined that, in such a situation, UIM carriers are obligated\\n “to first provide coverage, and later seek an offset through reimbursement or\\n exercise of subrogation rights.” Id. at ___, 747 S.E.2d at 394. Consequently, the\\n court determined that upon the exhaustion of “all policies applicable to Mr.\\n Buchanan’s vehicle,” Lunsford’s “UIM coverage was triggered,” and “Farm Bureau\\n was not at liberty to withhold coverage until [Lunsford] reached settlement\\n agreements with Mr. Mills and Mr. Crowder.” Id. at ___, 747 S.E.2d at 394.\\n Farm Bureau alternatively argued that, even it were required to provide UIM\\n coverage, the trial court nevertheless erred in ordering it to pay pre- and postjudgment\\n interest and costs. In support of this contention, Farm Bureau cited our\\n decision in Sproles v. Greene, 329 N.C. 603, 613, 407 S.E.2d 497, 503 (1991), in\\n which we concluded that North Carolina’s compulsory motor vehicle insurance laws\\n LUNSFORD V. MILLS\\n Opinion of the Court\\n -7-\\n do not impose an obligation on liability insurers to pay interest on a judgment in\\n excess of the insurer’s policy limits, but rather, such an obligation “is governed by\\n the terms of the [insurance] policy.” The Court of Appeals believed that Sproles was\\n distinguishable on the ground that Sproles held that a “UIM carrier is not required\\n to pay pre and post-judgment interest on behalf of the insured where the judgment\\n has been entered against the insured.” Lunsford, ___ N.C. App. at ___, 747 S.E.2d\\n at 395 (citing Sproles, 329 N.C. at 605, 407 S.E.2d at 498). Here, in contrast, “the\\n judgment was entered against Farm Bureau itself, not against its insured\\n (Plaintiff).” Id. at ___, 747 S.E.2d at 395. Thus the court concluded that Sproles\\n “ha[d] no bearing on the case at hand” and upheld the trial court’s award of interest\\n and costs. Id. at ___, 747 S.E.2d at 395 (2013).\\n Farm Bureau petitioned this Court for discretionary review of the Court of\\n Appeals’ decision regarding both the UIM coverage and the judgment interest\\n issues. We allowed Farm Bureau’s petition with respect to both questions. 367\\n N.C. 259, 749 S.E.2d 843 (2013).\\n Standard of Review\\n Under Rule 56(c) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, summary\\n judgment is appropriate when the record establishes that there are no genuine\\n issues of material fact and that any party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\\n N.C. R. Civ. P. 56(c); e.g., In re Will of Jones, 362 N.C. 569, 573, 669 S.E.2d 572, 576\\n (2008). Here the parties have stipulated to the material facts, and therefore, the\\n LUNSFORD V. MILLS\\n Opinion of the Court\\n -8-\\n only question for our consideration is whether either party is entitled to judgment\\n as a matter of law. Answering this question primarily involves interpretation of the\\n Motor Vehicle Safety and Financial Responsibility Act of 1953 (commonly referred\\n to as the “FRA”), N.C.G.S. §§ 20-279.1 through -279.39 (2013), and examination of\\n the terms of Farm Bureau’s motor vehicle insurance policy, each a question of law.\\n See Brown v. Flowe, 349 N.C. 520, 523, 507 S.E.2d 894, 896 (1998) (“A question of\\n statutory interpretation is ultimately a question of law for the courts.”); Wachovia\\n Bank & Trust v. Westchester Fire Ins. Co., 276 N.C. 348, 354, 172 S.E.2d 518, 522\\n (1970) (observing that the interpretation of “the language used in [a] policy of\\n insurance” is “a question of law”). This Court reviews questions of law de novo,\\n meaning that we consider the matter anew and freely substitute our judgment for\\n the judgment of the lower court. In re Greens of Pine Glen Ltd. P’ship, 356 N.C.\\n 642, 647, 576 S.E.2d 316, 319 (2003) (citation omitted).\\n Underinsured Motorist Coverage\\n The parties’ principal dispute centers on the proper interpretation of\\n subdivision 20-279.21(b)(4), the FRA’s provision governing UIM coverage. The\\n primary objective of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the\\n intent of the legislature. Burgess v. Your House of Raleigh, Inc., 326 N.C. 205, 209,\\n 388 S.E.2d 134, 137 (1990). “If the language of the statute is clear and is not\\n ambiguous, we must conclude that the legislature intended the statute to be\\n implemented according to the plain meaning of its terms.” Hyler v.

Thus, in effectuating legislative intent, it is our\\n duty to give effect to the words actually used in a statute and not to delete words\\n used or to insert words not used. N.C. Dep’t of Corr. v. N.C. Med. Bd., 363 N.C. 189,\\n 201, 675 S.E.2d 641, 649 (2009); accord In re Banks, 295 N.C. 236, 239, 244 S.E.2d\\n 386, 388-89 (1978) (“[C]ourts must give [a clear and unambiguous] statute its plain\\n and definite meaning, and are without power to interpolate, or superimpose,\\n provisions and limitations not contained therein.”).\\n The first paragraph of subdivision 20-279.21(b)(4) defines the term\\n “underinsured highway vehicle” as\\n a highway vehicle with respect to the ownership,\\n maintenance, or use of which, the sum of the limits of\\n liability under all bodily injury liability bonds and\\n insurance policies applicable at the time of the accident is\\n less than the applicable limits of underinsured motorist\\n coverage for the vehicle involved in the accident and\\n insured under the owner’s policy.\\n N.C.G.S. § 20-279.21(b)(4). The statute further sets out when UIM coverage is\\n triggered:\\n Underinsured motorist coverage is deemed to apply when,\\n by reason of payment of judgment or settlement, all\\n liability bonds or insurance policies providing coverage for\\n bodily injury caused by the ownership, maintenance, or\\n use of the underinsured highway vehicle have been\\n LUNSFORD V. MILLS\\n Opinion of the Court\\n -10-\\n exhausted.\\n Id. (“triggering provision”).\\n Farm Bureau reads the reference to “all bodily injury liability bonds and\\n insurance policies applicable at the time of the accident” in the definition of an\\n underinsured highway vehicle to mean that, in determining whether UIM coverage\\n is triggered, the insured’s UIM coverage limit must be compared to the sum of all of\\n the liability limits of all the at-fault motorists. Thus, according to Farm Bureau, as\\n a prerequisite to receiving UIM benefits, Lunsford was required to exhaust not only\\n Buchanan’s liability limits, but also the policy limits of Mills and Crowder to the\\n extent that they are liable as joint tortfeasors. We read subdivision 20-279.21(b)(4)\\n differently.\\n As an initial matter, the reference to “all bodily injury liability bonds and\\n insurance policies applicable at the time of the accident” is found in the UIM\\n statute’s definition of an “underinsured highway vehicle,” not in the triggering\\n provision. The location of the clause in a separate and distinct provision of the UIM\\n statute indicates that the clause relates solely to an underinsured highway vehicle\\n and not, as Farm Bureau suggests, to all the vehicles involved in an accident. See\\n Colonial Penn Ins. Co. v. Salti, 84 A.D.2d 350, 352, 446 N.Y.S.2d 77, 79 (N.Y. App.\\n Div. 1982) (“[T]he [UIM] endorsement affords coverage for bodily injury arising out\\n of the use of an underinsured highway vehicle and the clause ‘the limits of liability\\n LUNSFORD V. MILLS\\n Opinion of the Court\\n -11-\\n under all bodily injury liability bonds or insurance policies applicable at the time of\\n the accident’ . . . should be read to relate . . . to [the underinsured] vehicle only, and\\n not, as [the insurer] contends, to the total number of vehicles involved in the\\n accident.” (emphasis added)).\\n An examination of the actual language of the triggering provision further\\n undermines Farm Bureau’s reading of the statute to provide that UIM coverage is\\n not triggered until “all liability limits applicable ‘at the time of the accident’ ” are\\n exhausted. The plain language of the triggering provision identifies the liability\\n bonds and insurance policies relevant to determining whether UIM coverage is\\n triggered as those bonds and policies relating to “the ownership, maintenance, or\\n use of the underinsured highway vehicle.” N.C.G.S. § 20-279.21(b)(4) (emphasis\\n added). A statute’s use of the definite article—“the”—indicates that the legislature\\n intended the term modified to have a singular referent. See Renz v. Grey Adver.,\\n Inc., 135 F.3d 217, 222 (2d Cir. 1997) (“Placing the article ‘the’ in front of a word\\n connotes the singularity of the word modified.”); see also Gen. Accident Ins. Co. v.\\n Wheeler, 221 Conn. 206, 211, 603 A.2d 385, 387 (1992) (concluding, under an\\n insurance regulation providing that “the ‘insurer shall undertake to pay on behalf of\\n the insured all sums which the insured shall be legally entitled to recover as\\n damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured [or underinsured] motor\\n vehicle because of bodily injury sustained by the insured caused by an accident\\n involving the uninsured [or underinsured] motor vehicle,’ ” that an insured is\\n LUNSFORD V. MILLS\\n Opinion of the Court\\n -12-\\n required to exhaust “the insurance coverage of only one tortfeasor” in order to\\n recover UIM benefits (brackets in original)).\\n Farm Bureau’s interpretation effectively rewrites the triggering provision to\\n provide that UIM coverage applies only once all liability bonds or insurance policies\\n providing coverage for any party potentially liable for the insured’s bodily injuries\\n have been exhausted. But that is not what the statute says. The plain language of\\n the triggering provision establishes that when an insured suffers bodily injury\\n caused by the ownership, maintenance, or use of an underinsured highway vehicle,\\n and when the liability bonds or insurance policies providing coverage for that\\n vehicle have been exhausted, UIM coverage is triggered. Accordingly, a UIM\\n carrier’s statutory obligation to provide UIM benefits is triggered when the insurer\\n of a single vehicle meeting the definition of an underinsured highway vehicle\\n tenders its liability limits to the UIM claimant through an offer of settlement or in\\n satisfaction of a judgment. See Register v. White, 358 N.C. 691, 698, 599 S.E.2d 549,\\n 555 (2004) (“Exhaustion occurs when the liability carrier has tendered the limits of\\n its policy in a settlement offer or in satisfaction of a judgment.”).\\n Farm Bureau contends, however, that this interpretation of subdivision 20-\\n 279.21(b)(4) has been “expressly rejected by the legislature.” In support of this\\n argument, Farm Bureau points to the General Assembly’s consideration and\\n ultimate rejection of a bill proposed in the 1983 legislative session that was\\n LUNSFORD V. MILLS\\n Opinion of the Court\\n -13-\\n designed “to clarify the law concerning UIM coverage.” The proposed bill would\\n have completely repealed subdivision 20-279.21(b)(4), the FRA’s provision governing\\n UIM coverage, and amended subdivision 20-279.21(b)(3), the provision governing\\n uninsured motorist coverage, so that an underinsured motor vehicle would have\\n constituted an “uninsured motor vehicle” to the extent of “the difference between\\n the limits of the bodily injury liability insurance and property damage liability\\n insurance coverages on such motor vehicle and the limits of the uninsured motorist\\n coverage provided under the insured’s motor vehicle liability insurance policy.” H.\\n 60, 135th Gen. Assemb., Reg. Sess. (N.C. 1983) (emphasis added).\\n The fact that this proposed bill was not enacted is unavailing. When, as here,\\n “the language of a statute expresses the legislative intent in clear and unambiguous\\n terms, the words employed must be taken as the final expression of the meaning\\n intended unaffected by its legislative history.” Piedmont Canteen Serv., Inc. v.\\n Johnson, 256 N.C. 155, 161, 123 S.E.2d 582, 586 (1962) (citations omitted); accord\\n Wake Cares, Inc. v.

Section 20-279.21 “was passed to address circumstances where ‘ “the\\n LUNSFORD V.

We have recognized the remedial nature of\\n subdivision 20-279.21(b)(4) and explained that the statute should be “liberally\\n construed” in order to accomplish its purpose of “protect[ing] . . . innocent victims\\n who may be injured by financially irresponsible motorists.” Proctor v. N.C. Farm\\n Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 324 N.C. 221, 224-25, 376 S.E.2d 761, 763 (1989). To that\\n end, subdivision 20-279.21(b)(4)—as well as the FRA as a whole—should be\\n “interpreted to provide the innocent victim with the fullest possible protection.” Id.\\n at 225, 376 S.E.2d at 764.\\n If Farm Bureau’s interpretation were adopted, insureds would be required to\\n pursue all claims, including weak, tenuous ones, against all potentially liable\\n parties, no matter how impractical, before being eligible to collect their contractedfor\\n UIM benefits. Placing this burden on insureds—who, like Lunsford, commonly\\n suffer serious injuries and need prompt payment of benefits to pay medical\\n expenses and other costs—would substantially delay the recovery of UIM benefits\\n and promote litigation expenses that reduce insureds’ overall recovery. See\\n Wheeler, 221 Conn. at 213, 603 A.2d at 388 (observing that if the insured is not\\n LUNSFORD V. MILLS\\n Opinion of the Court\\n -15-\\n permitted to recover UIM benefits until exhausting all liability limits of all joint\\n tortfeasors, “the insured could be required to pursue claims of weak liability\\n against third parties, thereby fostering marginal and costly litigation in our\\n courts”). Because Farm Bureau’s interpretation of subdivision 20-279.21(b)(4)\\n would fail to provide innocent victims “the fullest possible protection,” we reject\\n Farm Bureau’s proposed construction. See Proctor, 324 N.C. at 225-26, 376 S.E.2d\\n at 764 (rejecting insurer’s construction of subdivision 20-279.21(b)(4) that\\n “result[ed] in the least possible protection for the innocent victim of an\\n underinsured tortfeasor” and thus “undermine[d] the intent and purpose of the\\n statute”).\\n Our conclusion that an insured may recover UIM benefits upon exhausting\\n the liability limits of a single at-fault motorist is further buttressed by examining\\n the subrogation provision of section 20-279.21. See Faizan v. Grain Dealers Mut.\\n Ins. Co., 254 N.C. 47, 53, 118 S.E.2d 303, 307 (1961) (construing provisions of the\\n FRA in pari materia). The third paragraph of subdivision 20-279.21(b)(4) states in\\n pertinent part:\\n An underinsured motorist insurer may at its\\n option, upon a claim pursuant to underinsured motorist\\n coverage, pay moneys without there having first been an\\n exhaustion of the liability insurance policy covering the\\n ownership, use, and maintenance of the underinsured\\n highway vehicle. In the event of payment, the\\n underinsured motorist insurer shall be either: (a) entitled\\n to receive by assignment from the claimant any right or\\n (b) subrogated to the claimant’s right regarding any claim\\n LUNSFORD V. MILLS\\n Opinion of the Court\\n -16-\\n the claimant has or had against the owner, operator, or\\n maintainer of the underinsured highway vehicle, provided\\n that the amount of the insurer’s right by subrogation or\\n assignment shall not exceed payments made to the\\n claimant by the insurer.\\n N.C.G.S. § 20-279.21(b)(4); see also id. § 20-279.21(b)(3) (providing an insurer a\\n right to reimbursement from settlement proceeds to the extent the insurer has\\n made a “payment to any person under the coverage required by this section and\\n subject to the terms and conditions of coverage”).\\n If, as Farm Bureau argues, insureds were required to exhaust the liability\\n policies of all at-fault motorists as a prerequisite to recovering UIM coverage, there\\n would be no need to provide UIM carriers subrogation or reimbursement rights, and\\n consequently, these provisions would be rendered meaningless. See Leslie v. W.H.\\n Transp. Co., 338 F. Supp. 2d 684, 689 (S.D. W. Va. 2004) (“The reservation of a\\n subrogation right indicates that [the insurer] foresees situations in which an\\n insured receives UIM benefits and [the insurer] then pursues a claim against a\\n tortfeasor who is legally liable for the damages suffered by the insured. If the\\n insured were required to exhaust every tortfeasor’s policy limit before receiving\\n UIM benefits, it is hard to imagine a UIM scenario in which subrogation rights\\n would arise.”). Yet it is a fundamental principle of statutory interpretation that\\n courts should “evaluate [a] statute as a whole and . . . not construe an individual\\n section in a manner that renders another provision of the same statute\\n meaningless.” Polaroid Corp. v.

Farm Bureau could have preserved its subrogation rights by advancing\\n its UIM policy limits. See State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v.

UIM coverage.” Id. at 142, 566 S.E.2d at 838\\n (citations, emphasis, and quotation marks omitted). We perceive no inherent conflict\\n between Haight’s articulation of the intended purpose of the UIM statute and the principle\\n we reaffirmed in Proctor that subdivision 20-279.21(b)(4), as a remedial statute, must be\\n “interpreted to provide the innocent victim with the fullest possible protection.” Proctor,\\n 324 N.C. at 225, 376 S.E.2d at 764. Even if, as we have held, a UIM carrier is required to\\n LUNSFORD V. MILLS\\n Opinion of the Court\\n -18-\\n N.C.G.S. § 20-279.21(b)(3). But by not advancing its policy limits, Farm Bureau\\n waived its subrogation rights. See N.C.G.S. § 20-279.21(b)(4) (prohibiting insurers\\n from exercising any right of subrogation when “the insurer fails to advance a\\n payment to the insured in an amount equal to the tentative settlement within 30\\n days” of receiving written notice of the proposed settlement).\\n In sum, we believe that the structure and plain language of subdivision 20-\\n 279.21(b)(4), the purpose behind the UIM statute, and the legislature’s inclusion of\\n subrogation rights for insurers, compel the conclusion that UIM coverage is\\n triggered upon the exhaustion of the policy limits of a single at-fault motorist.\\n Accordingly, upon Allstate’s tender of its policy limit of $50,000 on behalf of\\n Buchanan, UIM coverage was triggered under subdivision 20-279.21(b)(4), and\\n Lunsford was entitled to recover UIM benefits according to the terms of his policy\\n with Farm Bureau. We therefore affirm the Court of Appeals’ decision on this issue.\\n Judgment Interest and Costs\\n Farm Bureau also challenges the Court of Appeals’ determination that\\n Lunsford is entitled to pre- and post-judgment interest and costs. Farm Bureau\\n contends that the award of these damages, taxed in excess of Lunsford’s UIM\\n provide UIM coverage upon exhaustion of the liability limits of a single tortfeasor, the\\n carrier may still seek recovery of any overpayment through the exercise of its rights to\\n subrogation or reimbursement. Through these mechanisms, insurers are able to recoup\\n any overpayment and insureds are divested of any so-called “windfall.”\\n LUNSFORD V.

We agree.\\n We have established that “when a statute is applicable to the terms of a\\n policy of insurance, the provisions of that statute become terms of the policy to the\\n same extent as if they were written in it, and if the terms of the policy conflict with\\n the statute, the provisions of the statute prevail.” Id. at 6, 430 S.E.2d at 898 (citing\\n Sutton v. Aetna Cas. & Surety Co., 325 N.C. 259, 263, 382 S.E.2d 759, 762 (1989)).\\n Section 20-279.21 is silent with respect to pre- and post-judgment interest, and thus\\n subsection 24-5(b), the statute governing judgment interest, “is not a part of the\\n Financial Responsibility Act so as to be written into every liability policy.” Id.\\n (citing Sproles, 329 N.C. at 613, 407 S.E.2d at 503). When, as here, no statutory\\n provision dictates a liability insurer’s obligation to pay interest in excess of its\\n policy limits, such an obligation “is governed by the language of the policy.” Id.\\n (citing Sproles, 329 N.C. at 612-13, 407 S.E.2d at 502-03) (emphasis omitted).\\n The pertinent language in Lunsford’s business and personal policies states\\n that Farm Bureau promises to pay, up to its UIM policy limit,\\n all sums the “insured” is legally entitled to recover as\\n compensatory damages from the owner or driver of:\\n a. An “uninsured motor vehicle” because of “bodily\\n injury” sustained by the “insured” and caused\\n by an “accident”; and\\n b. b. An “uninsured motor vehicle” as defined in\\n LUNSFORD V. MILLS\\n Opinion of the Court\\n -20-\\n Paragraphs a. and c. of the definition of\\n “uninsured motor vehicle”, because of “property\\n damage” caused by an “accident”.\\n The owner’s or driver’s liability for these damages must\\n result from the ownership, maintenance or use of the\\n “uninsured motor vehicle”.\\n (Emphasis added.) The policies’ definition of an “uninsured motor vehicle” includes\\n an “underinsured motor vehicle.”\\n In Baxley, 334 N.C. at 6-7, 430 S.E.2d at 899, we examined substantially\\n similar policy language:\\n The contractual language [at issue] is [the UIM\\n carrier]’s promise to pay, up to its UIM policy limit,\\n damages which a covered person is legally entitled to\\n recover from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor\\n vehicle because of:\\n 1. Bodily injury sustained by a covered person and\\n caused by an accident; and\\n 2. Property damage caused by an accident.\\n Holding that interest is an element of “damages,” id. at 11, 430 S.E.2d at 901, we\\n held that, based on the pertinent policy language, the UIM carrier in Baxley was\\n “obligated to pay pre-judgment interest up to its policy limits.” Id. at 6, 430 S.E.2d\\n at 898 (emphasis omitted). Our reasoning in Baxley regarding judgment interest\\n has similarly been applied to costs. See Wiggins v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 112\\n N.C. App. 26, 35-36, 434 S.E.2d 642, 648 (1993) (rejecting, based on Baxley, the\\n insurer’s contention “that ‘damages’ does not include costs or interest”).\\n LUNSFORD V. MILLS\\n Opinion of the Court\\n -21-\\n The relevant language in Farm Bureau’s policy is, we believe, materially\\n indistinguishable from the policy language at issue in Baxley. Accordingly, the\\n Court of Appeals erred in concluding that Farm Bureau was required to pay preand\\n post-judgment interest and costs in excess of its remaining UIM policy limit of\\n $350,000. Because Farm Bureau contractually capped its obligation to pay\\n “compensatory damages” at its UIM coverage limit, Farm Bureau is not required to\\n pay interest and costs over and above the $350,000 coverage amount. See Baxley,\\n 334 N.C. at 11, 430 S.E.2d at 901 (“Since [the UIM carrier] promised to pay [the\\n insured]’s resulting damages, it must now do so, up to, but not in excess of, its UIM\\n policy limits.”).\\n Lunsford nonetheless claims that Farm Bureau should be required to pay\\n pre- and post-judgment interest because the judgment “was entered directly against\\n Farm Bureau” due to Farm Bureau’s “breach of its obligations under its insurance\\n contract.” This argument is misplaced. There is no underlying breach of contract\\n claim against Farm Bureau in this case, and thus, such a claim could not have been\\n the basis for the trial court’s award of interest and costs. Rather, the basis for the\\n award is Farm Bureau’s promise to pay, up to its UIM coverage limit, the\\n “compensatory damages” resulting from the named defendants’ negligence. In such\\n circumstances, our precedent “clearly establish[es]” that the extent to which a UIM\\n carrier is required to pay judgment interest is controlled by “the specific terms of\\n [the] policy.” Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Mabe, 342 N.C. 482, 491, 467 S.E.2d 34,\\n LUNSFORD V. MILLS\\n Opinion of the Court\\n -22-\\n 40 (1996). Farm Bureau was permitted to, and did in fact, cap its liability for\\n damages, including interest, at the amount of its UIM coverage limit. We\\n accordingly reverse the Court of Appeals’ decision with respect to interest and costs.\\n Conclusion\\n We affirm that part of the decision of the Court of Appeals holding than an\\n insured is only required to exhaust the liability insurance coverage of a single atfault\\n motorist in order to trigger the insurer’s obligation to provide UIM benefits.\\n We reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals awarding interest and costs against\\n the insurer in an amount that exceeds the amount the insurer contractually\\n promised to pay under the terms of its policy with the insured. This case is\\n remanded to the Court of Appeals for further remand to the Superior Court,\\n McDowell County, for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\\n AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\\n Justice HUNTER did not participate in the consideration or decision of this\\n case.\\n No. 385PA13 – Lunsford v. Mills\\n Justice NEWBY dissenting in part and concurring in part.\\n The purpose of underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage in our state is to serve\\n as a safeguard when tortfeasors’ liability policies do not provide sufficient\\n recovery—that is, when the tortfeasors are “under insured.” This is simply not the\\n case here. Plaintiff incurred damages amounting to $900,000. He brought suit\\n jointly and severally against responsible tortfeasors whose total liability limits were\\n $1,050,000. Those combined liability limits were more than sufficient to satisfy\\n plaintiff’s damages and were more than twice as high as plaintiff’s $400,000 UIM\\n limits. Not only does the majority incorrectly hold that UIM coverage was\\n necessary in this instance, but the majority’s outcome also leaves plaintiff with\\n $350,000 in excess of his agreed-to damages. By contrast, I would hold that UIM\\n coverage was not activated in this case. Rather, under the UIM statute, coverage\\n only applies when the policyholder’s UIM limits are more than the combined limits\\n of the insurance coverage of all jointly and severally liable tortfeasors against whom\\n the plaintiff files suit. Consequently, I respectfully dissent.\\n At the time of the accident, the jointly and severally liable tortfeasors, Mills,\\n his employer Crowder, and Buchanan, carried liability policies totaling $1,050,000\\n while plaintiff was covered by two UIM policies with North Carolina Farm Bureau\\n Mutual Insurance Company (Farm Bureau) with combined limits of $400,000.\\n LUNSFORD V. MILLS\\n Newby, J., dissenting in part and concurring in part\\n -2-\\n After plaintiff filed suit against Mills, Crowder, and Buchanan, Buchanan’s\\n provider, Allstate, tendered to plaintiff the $50,000 limits of Buchanan’s policy. Six\\n months later, plaintiff settled his claim with defendants Mills’ and Crowder’s\\n coverage provider for $850,000. After the trial court approved plaintiff’s settlement\\n with the named defendants, Farm Bureau, as an unnamed defendant, moved for\\n summary judgment, contending that plaintiff was not entitled to UIM coverage\\n because the combined policy limits of the defendants exceeded plaintiff’s UIM\\n limits. Plaintiff also moved for summary judgment, insisting that Buchanan was an\\n underinsured driver and that plaintiff was thus entitled to Farm Bureau’s UIM\\n policy limits of $400,000 less an offset of $50,000 for Buchanan’s Allstate insurance\\n payment. The trial court entered judgment in plaintiff’s favor for $350,000, plus\\n costs and pre- and post-judgment interest. As a result, plaintiff received $50,000\\n from Buchanan’s insurer, $850,000 from the settlement with Mills and Crowder,\\n and $350,000 from his own UIM policy with Farm Bureau for a total of $1,250,000\\n while settling his damages claims with the actual tortfeasors for only $900,000,\\n which left untapped $150,000 of tortfeasor insurance.\\n The majority’s holding is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of UIM\\n coverage and the implementing statute, as well as a misunderstanding of Farm\\n Bureau’s argument. UIM insurance in North Carolina developed out of uninsured\\n motorist (UM) insurance. James E. Snyder, Jr., North Carolina Automobile\\n Insurance Law § 30-1 (3d ed. 1999). UM insurance provides recovery for a\\n LUNSFORD V. MILLS\\n Newby, J., dissenting in part and concurring in part\\n -3-\\n policyholder injured in an auto accident by the motor vehicle of a tortfeasor who has\\n no liability insurance. Id. By comparison, UIM coverage provides a secondary\\n source of recovery for an insured when the tortfeasor has insurance, but the\\n tortfeasor’s liability limits are insufficient to compensate the injured party. Sutton\\n v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 325 N.C. 259, 263, 382 S.E.2d 759, 762 (1989), superseded\\n on other grounds by statute, Act of July 12, 1991, ch. 646, 1991 N.C. Sess.

The UM and UIM statute is part of North Carolina’s Motor\\n Vehicle Safety and Financial Responsibility Act of 1953 (Act). N.C.G.S. §§ 20-279.1\\n to 279.39 (2013). The Act’s purpose is\\n to compensate the innocent victims of financially\\n irresponsible motorists. The Act is remedial in nature\\n and is to be liberally construed so that the beneficial\\n purpose intended by its enactment may be accomplished.\\n The purpose of the Act, we have said, is best served when\\n [every provision of the Act] is interpreted to provide the\\n innocent victim with the fullest possible protection.\\n Liberty Mut.

In other words, UIM coverage puts the insured\\n claimant back in the position he would have occupied had the tortfeasor been\\n insured at limits equal to the claimant’s UIM limits. See Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co.\\n v. Haight, 152 N.C. App. 137, 142, 566 S.E.2d 835, 838 (2002) (noting the statute’s\\n goal of putting a policy holder “in the same position that the policy holder would\\n have been in if the tortfeasor had had liability coverage equal to the amount of the\\n UM/UIM coverage” (citations and emphasis omitted)), disc. rev. denied, 356 N.C.\\n 675, 577 S.E.2d 627 (2003).\\n Two provisions in the UIM statute in particular demonstrate this intent by\\n the legislature to make UIM coverage a source of compensation secondary to\\n tortfeasors’ liability policies. Elec. Supply Co. of Durham v. Swain Elec. Co., 328\\n N.C. 651, 656, 403 S.E.2d 291, 294 (1991) (observing that, inter alia, “we are guided\\n by the structure of the statute” in determining legislative intent (citations omitted)).\\n The first is the reduction provision, which states:\\n In any event, the limit of underinsured motorist\\n coverage applicable to any claim is determined to be the\\n difference between the amount paid to the claimant under\\n the exhausted liability policy or policies and the limit of\\n underinsured motorist coverage applicable to the motor\\n vehicle involved in the accident.\\n LUNSFORD V. MILLS\\n Newby, J., dissenting in part and concurring in part\\n -5-\\n N.C.G.S. § 20-279.21(b)(4) (“reduction provision”). Under the reduction provision, a\\n UIM carrier reduces its applicable policy limits by amounts paid to the claimant\\n from tortfeasors’ exhausted policies.\\n The second supporting provision is the offset or recovery provision found in\\n N.C.G.S. § 20-279.21(b)(3), which is incorporated by reference into subdivision 20-\\n 279.21(b)(4):\\n In the event of payment to any person under the\\n coverage required by this section and subject to the terms\\n and conditions of coverage, the insurer making payment\\n shall, to the extent thereof, be entitled to the proceeds of\\n any settlement for judgment resulting from the exercise of\\n any limits of recovery of that person against any person or\\n organization legally responsible for the bodily injury for\\n which the payment is made, including the proceeds\\n recoverable from the assets of the insolvent insurer.\\n Id. at § 20-279.21(b)(3). This provision entitles a UIM carrier to use a claimant’s\\n judgment proceeds to recoup the UIM carrier’s payments to the claimant. The\\n presence of the reduction and offset provisions in the statute evinces a legislative\\n intent for UIM coverage to be applicable only to the extent that other sources of\\n recovery fail to compensate for the injury up to the UIM limits.2 Elec.

Thus, an\\n insured plaintiff’s UIM recovery “is controlled contractually by the amount of the\\n UIM policy limits purchased and available to her, not fortuitously by the number of\\n tortfeasors involved in the accident.” Nikiper v.

The majority’s holding runs contrary to the nature and purpose of UIM\\n coverage.\\n With this understanding of the UIM statute’s purpose in mind, it is necessary\\n to consider closely the statute’s controlling provision in this case—the activation\\n provision. As an initial matter, the majority misreads Farm Bureau’s argument.\\n Farm Bureau is not insisting that the statute requires plaintiff “to exhaust not only\\n Buchanan’s liability limits, but also the policy limits of Mills and Crowder to the\\n extent that they are liable as joint tortfeasors” in order for plaintiff to receive UIM\\n benefits. Rather, Farm Bureau is asserting that UIM coverage is not applicable at\\n all because plaintiff implicated $1,050,000 in liability coverage when he sued the\\n LUNSFORD V. MILLS\\n Newby, J., dissenting in part and concurring in part\\n -7-\\n three tortfeasors. As a result of this mischaracterization, the majority errs in its\\n approach to the statute by focusing on the UIM’s triggering (exhaustion) provision\\n without first fully considering subdivision (b)(4)’s activation provision.3 The\\n distinction between the activation and triggering provisions is critical because if no\\n vehicle meets the definition of an underinsured vehicle under the activation\\n provision, then consideration of the subsequent triggering provision is unnecessary.\\n The activation provision is found in subdivision (b)(4), which is the portion of\\n the statute governing UIM coverage. N.C.G.S. § 20-279.21(b)(4). A UIM carrier\\n pays on its policy to an injured claimant when (1) the auto accident involves a\\n tortfeasor who meets the statute’s definition of an underinsured highway vehicle\\n (the activation provision); and (2) the underinsured highway vehicle’s liability\\n coverage has been exhausted (triggering provision). Id.4 The UIM statute’s\\n activation provision defines an underinsured highway vehicle as:\\n [A] highway vehicle with respect to the ownership,\\n maintenance, or use of which, the sum of the limits of\\n liability under all bodily injury liability bonds and\\n insurance policies applicable at the time of the accident is\\n less than the applicable limits of underinsured motorist\\n 3 The majority’s analysis and interpretation of the activation provision is relegated\\n to one paragraph with a citation to a case from New York interpreting, against the insurer,\\n a provision in a claimant’s insurance policy. That case did not interpret a statute and offers\\n no support for an interpretation of North Carolina’s statute.\\n 4 The relevant portions of the current version of this statute are identical to the 2009\\n version of the statute, which is the version applicable to this case. White v. Mote, 270 N.C.\\n 544, 555, 155 S.E.2d 75, 82 (1967) (“Laws in effect at the time of issuance of a policy of\\n insurance become a part of the contract . . . .”).\\n LUNSFORD V. MILLS\\n Newby, J., dissenting in part and concurring in part\\n -8-\\n coverage for the vehicle involved in the accident and\\n insured under the owner’s policy.\\n Id. The activation provision applies a comparison of limits approach—UIM\\n coverage is activated when the insured’s UIM policy limits are greater than the\\n liability limits of policies connected with the tortfeasor’s ownership, maintenance, or\\n use of a highway vehicle. 3 Irvin E. Schermer & William J. Schermer, Automobile\\n Liability Insurance § 38:7 (4th ed. Dec. 2004) [hereinafter Automobile Liability\\n Insurance]. In a scenario involving a single insured claimant and a single\\n tortfeasor, application of the statute’s activation provision is straightforward. If the\\n insured’s UIM limits are greater than the tortfeasor’s liability limits, the insured’s\\n UIM coverage is activated. N.C.G.S. § 20-279.21(b)(4). Only then does subdivision\\n (b)(4)’s triggering provision become relevant.\\n Under the triggering provision, once the tortfeasor’s liability limits have been\\n paid out to the insured, if the injuries have not been adequately compensated, the\\n insured can collect from the UIM carrier up to the maximum amount of the UIM\\n coverage limits minus the amount paid to the claimant under the tortfeasor’s\\n exhausted policy. Id. The net effect is that UIM coverage puts the insured claimant\\n back in the position he would have occupied had the tortfeasor been insured at\\n limits equal to the claimant’s UIM limits. See Haight, 152 N.C. App. at 142, 566\\n S.E.2d at 838.\\n LUNSFORD V. MILLS\\n Newby, J., dissenting in part and concurring in part\\n -9-\\n Though the activation provision’s application is clear when only one\\n tortfeasor is involved, we have not previously addressed whether, in a multiple\\n tortfeasor scenario, the insured’s UIM policy limits should be compared individually\\n to each tortfeasor’s liability limits or compared to the sum of the liability limits of\\n all tortfeasors. When read in the broader context of the statute, the UIM’s\\n activation provision instructs comparing the insured’s policy limits to the sum of the\\n liability of all jointly and severally liable tortfeasors. More specifically, a vehicle is\\n underinsured when “the sum of the limits of liability under all bodily injury liability\\n bonds and insurance policies applicable at the time of the accident” with respect to\\n the use of the vehicle is less than an insured’s UIM limits. N.C.G.S. § 20-\\n 279.21(b)(4).\\n This interpretation of the activation provision is in consonance with the\\n surrounding provisions of the statute and in keeping with the overall legislative\\n intent of requiring UIM coverage to provide a limited source of compensation when\\n a claimant is injured by tortfeasors who are collectively underinsured.5 Automobile\\n Liability Insurance § 41.3 at 41-42 (noting that under “comparison of limits”\\n statutes like North Carolina’s, “an underinsured motorist carrier may defeat\\n underinsured motorist coverage by pointing to other liability coverages available to\\n 5 The legislative history of the statute asserted by Farm Bureau and addressed by\\n the majority provides additional support for this interpretation.

Super. at 397, 557 A.2d at 334 (“We conclude that where the amount paid by\\n the insurors for the multiple tortfeasors equals or exceeds the amount of the UIM\\n coverage, plaintiff has no UIM claim.”); see also Sutton, 325 N.C. at 265, 382 S.E.2d\\n at 763 (observing that “[l]egislative intent can be ascertained not only from the\\n phraseology of the statute but also from the nature and purpose of the act and the\\n consequences which would follow its construction one way or the other”). In the\\n case at hand it is contrary to the purpose of the statute to conclude that Buchanan’s\\n vehicle alone activates UIM coverage when the combined liability limits of the\\n jointly and severally liable tortfeasors is $1,050,000 and plaintiff’s UIM coverage is\\n $400,000. Likewise, it is nonsensical to say a party is “underinsured” when the\\n injured party settles with the tortfeasors for $150,000 less than their policies’\\n coverage. State v. Beck, 359 N.C. 611, 614, 614 S.E.2d 274, 277 (2005) (“[W]here a\\n literal interpretation of the language of a statute will lead to absurd results, or\\n contravene the manifest purpose of the Legislature, as otherwise expressed, the\\n reason and purpose of the law shall control and the strict letter thereof shall be\\n disregarded.” (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)).\\n Interpreting the first portion of the activation provision to require comparing\\n UIM limits to the combined limits of jointly and severally liable tortfeasors is in\\n LUNSFORD V. MILLS\\n Newby, J., dissenting in part and concurring in part\\n -11-\\n harmony with the immediately succeeding portion of the activation provision, which\\n addresses UIM coverage in the context of multiple victims.

The succeeding portion of the provision states:\\n For purposes of an underinsured motorist claim asserted\\n by a person injured in an accident where more than one\\n person is injured, a highway vehicle will also be an\\n “underinsured highway vehicle” if the total amount\\n actually paid to that person under all bodily injury\\n liability bonds and insurance policies applicable at the\\n time of the accident is less than the applicable limits of\\n underinsured motorist coverage for the vehicle involved in\\n the accident and insured under the owner’s policy.\\n N.C.G.S. § 20-279.21(b)(4) (emphasis added). This provision unambiguously\\n contemplates comparing an insured plaintiff’s UIM limits broadly to payments the\\n plaintiff has received under all liability policies applicable at the time of the\\n accident. It does not restrict the comparison of limits test to a single tortfeasor.\\n Because this second portion of the activation provision requires aggregation of\\n liability limits for the purposes of comparison in a multiple victim scenario, under\\n the first portion of the activation provision, in a multiple tortfeasor scenario, the\\n same aggregation of liability limits must apply. Otherwise, in a multiple victim,\\n multiple tortfeasor scenario, the activation provision would produce conflicting\\n determinations as to the existence of an underinsured highway vehicle, with the\\n LUNSFORD V. MILLS\\n Newby, J., dissenting in part and concurring in part\\n -12-\\n first portion requiring a one-to-one comparison and the second portion requiring a\\n one-to-all comparison. An interpretation of the activation provision that limits\\n policy comparisons to a single tortfeasor violates a basic rule of statutory\\n interpretation by creating this conflict. Nationwide Mut.

The majority’s policy\\n concern disappears, however, when Farm Bureau’s position is correctly understood\\n to be that UIM coverage is not activated when the sum of the jointly and severally\\n liable tortfeasors’ policy limits is higher than plaintiff’s UIM limits.

Having chosen, however, to pursue simultaneously claims\\n against multiple tortfeasors whose combined liability limits far exceeded plaintiff’s\\n own UIM coverage, plaintiff was no longer able to access his UIM policy limits.\\n The majority further asserts, again under a misunderstanding of Farm\\n Bureau’s position, that requiring exhaustion before the receipt of UIM benefits\\n would render “meaningless” the provisions granting UIM carriers subrogation and\\n reimbursement rights. Under a proper consideration of Farm Bureau’s position and\\n LUNSFORD V. MILLS\\n Newby, J., dissenting in part and concurring in part\\n -14-\\n based on a proper reading of the activation provision, the provisions in question\\n would not be surplusage. The subrogation provision noted by the majority is\\n applicable when (a) underinsured motorist coverage is activated, and (b) a UIM\\n carrier voluntarily pays out to the insured before the triggering provision has been\\n satisfied. N.C.G.S. § 20-279.21(b)(4). This subrogation right is a necessary\\n assurance to a UIM carrier who voluntarily, id. (“at its option”), chooses to pay its\\n insured before exhaustion of a tortfeasor’s policy limits. Granted, this scenario is\\n not likely to occur. George L. Simpson, III, North Carolina Uninsured and\\n Underinsured Motorist Insurance § 4:2, at 351 (2013-2014 ed.) (noting that these\\n occasions are likely to be few). Nevertheless, this does not make the provision\\n superfluous.\\n Lastly, the majority misapprehends subdivision (b)(4)’s thirty-day\\n advancement-of-payment provision. The majority is incorrect in concluding that\\n Farm Bureau has forfeited its rights to recovery from the proceeds of the Mills and\\n Crowder settlement, N.C.G.S. § 20-279.21(b)(3) (incorporated into subdivision (b)(4)\\n and entitling the UIM carrier to “the proceeds of any settlement for judgment”\\n related to the plaintiff’s injuries), because it failed to “preserve its subrogation\\n rights” by not advancing its policy limits to plaintiff in a timely manner. When a\\n UIM carrier fails to advance payment within thirty days of notice of a settlement\\n with an underinsured motorist, it only forfeits its subrogation rights as to the\\n underinsured motorist under N.C.G.S. § 20-279.21(b)(4) (“No insurer shall exercise\\n LUNSFORD V. MILLS\\n Newby, J., dissenting in part and concurring in part\\n -15-\\n any right of subrogation or any right to approve settlement with the original owner,\\n operator, or maintainer of the underinsured highway vehicle under a policy\\n providing coverage against an underinsured motorist where the insurer has been\\n provided with written notice before a settlement between its insured and the\\n underinsured motorist and the insurer fails to advance a payment to the insured in\\n an amount equal to the tentative settlement within 30 days following receipt of that\\n notice.” (emphasis added)). That thirty-day deadline does not affect the UIM\\n carrier’s recovery rights against remaining tortfeasors. Furthermore, the offset\\n provision in N.C.G.S. § 20-279.21(b)(3) contains no requirement that a UIM carrier\\n first pay out its limits before being entitled to a recovery against the proceeds paid\\n by tortfeasors. Nothing in the statute dictates that a UIM carrier forfeits its rights\\n to offset against judgment recoveries from other parties by not paying out benefits\\n in a timely manner.\\n The case relied on by the majority in support of its forfeiture conclusion, State\\n Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Blackwelder, determined that the insurer\\n preserved subrogation rights against the underinsured tortfeasor; it does not\\n address a UIM carrier’s right to recover proceeds paid by other tortfeasors. 332\\n N.C. 135, 418 S.E.2d 229 (1992). In Blong, upon which the Court of Appeals relied\\n in arriving at a conclusion similar to that of the majority, a UIM carrier paid out its\\n policy limits to an insured and then argued it was entitled to an offset against any\\n amounts received by the insured in subsequent actions against additional parties.\\n LUNSFORD V. MILLS\\n Newby, J., dissenting in part and concurring in part\\n -16-\\n 159 N.C. App. at 367-68, 583 S.E.2d at 308-09. Noting the UM/UIM statute’s\\n remedial nature, Blong nonetheless concluded that “the Act appears to allow for the\\n type of subrogation that plaintiff claims.” Id. at 373, 583 S.E.2d at 312. Blong\\n answered the question whether the UIM carrier was entitled to an offset after\\n having already paid out its UIM limits and gave a sequence of “how the procedure\\n may play out.” Id. (emphasis added). The holding in Blong does not “clearly\\n obligate[ ] the UIM carrier to first provide coverage, and later seek [recovery]”.\\n Lunsford, ___ N.C. App. at ___, 747 S.E.2d at 394. Neither the UIM statute nor\\n case law provides the necessary support for the majority’s timing and forfeiture\\n determination regarding Farm Bureau’s entitlement to recovery. Furthermore,\\n reading the UIM statute as requiring Farm Bureau to pay out its UIM limits\\n promptly in order to protect the UIM policyholder is unnecessary; a UIM claimant\\n is already protected by the Unfair Claim Settlement Practices statute from delayed\\n payment, as noted above. Regardless whether UIM coverage was activated in this\\n case, Farm Bureau should nevertheless be entitled to recovery.\\n The majority’s insistence on reading the activation provision as limited only\\n to a comparison of the UIM policy limits and an individual tortfeasor’s policy limits\\n in this case allows plaintiff to collect from his $400,000 UIM policy even though he\\n has already settled damages claims for $900,000 with the tortfeasors, which is\\n $150,000 less than the maximum primary insurance coverage available. The\\n legislature never intended for UIM coverage to serve this role, providing plaintiff an\\n LUNSFORD V. MILLS\\n Newby, J., dissenting in part and concurring in part\\n -17-\\n excess recovery of $350,000. Rather the legislature intended for plaintiff’s UIM\\n policy to serve as a safeguard to protect plaintiff in the event the tortfeasors’\\n liability policies failed to compensate plaintiff for injuries up to $400,000. This\\n legislative intent is best carried out by first comparing plaintiff’s UIM limits to the\\n combined limits of all the auto policies implicated in the lawsuit. Even though the\\n majority’s holding provides “the fullest possible protection,” Pennington, 356 N.C. at\\n 574, 573 S.E.2d at 120, it contravenes the activation provision’s requirements and\\n the legislature’s intent to reduce UIM payouts by amounts recovered from all liable\\n parties. Accordingly, the trial court erred in requiring Farm Bureau to make the\\n $350,000 payment. Nevertheless, were UIM coverage properly implicated, I agree\\n with the majority that the awarding of costs and interests against the insurer is\\n limited contractually by the terms of the insured’s policy. Thus, I respectfully\\n concur in part and dissent in part.\"\"\"\n",

Omer, for plaintiff-appellee.\\n Kari Terhark, pro se, for defendant-appellant.\\n YOUNG, Judge.\\n This appeal arises out of a breach of contract. The trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in Plaintiff’s favor, nor did the trial court err in awarding Plaintiff attorney’s fees and damages. Accordingly, we find no error.\\n I. Factual and Procedural History\\n REYNOLDS-DOUGLASS V. TERHARK\\n Opinion of the Court\\n - 2 -\\n In July 2017, Dawn Reynolds-Douglass (“Plaintiff”) placed her home (“the property”) on the market for sale. Plaintiff hired real estate agent Dee Love (“Agent”), who advised Douglass to complete a North Carolina Residential Property and Owner’s Association Disclosure Statement (“Disclosure Statement”) pursuant to Chapter 47E of the North Carolina General Statutes. When Plaintiff did so, she inadvertently left two items unanswered: Item Number 27, inquiring as to whether there existed any easements, driveways, shared walls, or encroachments from or on adjacent property, and Item Number 33, asking whether any conveyance or transfer fees would be levied by the community homeowner’s association. Plaintiff signed the Disclosure Statement on 14 July 2017.\\n On 24 July 2017, Kari Terhark (“Defendant”) reviewed a copy of the Disclosure Statement and signed each page, including the pages containing Items Numbers 27 and 33. Defendant then reviewed and signed an Offer to Purchase and Contract (“Agreement”) for $250,000. Plaintiff accepted Defendant’s offer by signing the Agreement on 24 July 2017 and took the property off the market.\\n The Agreement included several provisions that are significant to this litigation. Paragraph 1(d) of the Agreement, entitled “Purchase Price,” provides for (i) a “Due Diligence Fee” of $2,000.00, delivered to the Seller by the Effective Date (in this case 24 July 2017), as well as (ii) an “Earnest Money Deposit” of $2,500.00 delivered no later than 14 August 2017. The Agreement also provided in Paragraph\\n REYNOLDS-DOUGLASS V. TERHARK\\n Opinion of the Court\\n - 3 -\\n 1(e) that the Earnest Money Deposit was to be paid to the Seller in the event of the Buyer’s breach of the Agreement, “as liquidated damages and as Seller’s sole and exclusive remedy for such breach, but without limiting . . . Seller’s right to retain the Due Diligence Fee.”\\n Further, Paragraph 1(e) of the Agreement provides that “[i]f legal proceedings are brought by Buyer or Seller against the other to recover the Earnest Money Deposit, the prevailing party in the proceeding shall be entitled to recover from the non-prevailing party reasonable attorney’s fees and court costs incurred in connection with the proceeding.” Paragraph 1(i) of the Agreement provides that the Due Diligence Fee “shall be the property of Seller upon the Effective Date and shall be a credit to Buyer at Closing.” The same paragraph continues, “[t]he Due Diligence Fee shall be non-refundable except in the event of a material breach of this Contract by seller …”\\n Defendant did not deliver the Due Diligence Fee on the Effective Date of 24 July 2017 as required by the Agreement. Defendant later informed Plaintiff, through Agent, that she refused to tender the fee until Plaintiff agreed to reduce the purchase price by $5,500.00, in order to allow Defendant to purchase new appliances and carpet for the property. Plaintiff refused, and Defendant attempted to terminate the Agreement by sending an email to Agent on 27 July 2017. Plaintiff terminated the Agreement on 28 July 2017 by serving Defendant with a “Notice to Buyer That Seller\\n REYNOLDS-DOUGLASS V. TERHARK\\n Opinion of the Court\\n - 4 -\\n is Exercising Their Unilateral Right to Terminate the Offer to Purchase and Contract.”\\n Plaintiff relisted the property. Defendant ended her relationship with Agent, obtained her own buyer’s agent, and made a second offer. Plaintiff countered this offer with an asking price of $245,000.00, no due diligence period and all major appliances not included. There were no further negotiations.\\n On 29 September 2017, Plaintiff sued Defendant in small claims court for the $2,000.00 Due Diligence Fee and the $2,500.00 Earnest Money Deposit included in the Agreement. On 30 October 2017, the presiding magistrate found that Defendant had breached the Agreement and entered judgment in favor of Plaintiff for $2,000.00.\\n Defendant appealed to Wake County District Court for de novo review. The matter was referred to arbitration, resulting in an arbitrator’s decision affirming the small claims judgment. Defendant then sought trial de novo in a district court trial. Following discovery, the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. On 26 February 2019, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment. Plaintiff then filed a Motion for Determination of Damages.\\n On 20 September 2019, the Court entered an Order awarding Plaintiff damages as follows: $2,000.00 for the Due Diligence Fee; $2,500.00 for the Earnest Money Deposit; $4,500.00 in prejudgment interest; and $13,067.70 in attorney fees, for Plaintiff’s claim of breach of contract but not for Plaintiff’s claim for promissory\\n REYNOLDS-DOUGLASS V. TERHARK\\n Opinion of the Court\\n - 5 -\\n estoppel or for fraud and punitive damages. Defendant filed timely written notice of appeal.\\n Plaintiff filed a Motion to Strike Portions of Defendant’s Reply Brief, and a Motion to Dismiss the appeal. This Court denied both motions.\\n II. Summary Judgment\\n “Our standard of review of an appeal from summary judgment is de novo; such judgment is appropriate only when the record shows that ‘there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.’” In re Will of Jones, 362 N.C. 569, 573, 669 S.E.2d 572, 576(2008) (quoting Forbis v. Neal, 361 N.C. 519, 524, 649 S.E.2d 382, 385 (2007)).\\n Defendant contends that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in Plaintiff’s favor, because there were genuine issues of material fact that Plaintiff failed to comply with the Residential Property Disclosure Act. We disagree.\\n North Carolina requires most sellers of residential property to provide potential purchasers with a disclosure statement containing disclosures regarding the property being sold. N.C. Gen. Stat. § 47E-4 (2020). The Disclosure Statement that Plaintiff provided was a standard form that the North Carolina Association of Realtors provided in compliance with Chapter 47E. Chapter 47E further provides that when the required disclosures are not timely provided, potential purchasers are vested with the ability to cancel any resulting contract, without penalty and under\\n REYNOLDS-DOUGLASS V. TERHARK\\n Opinion of the Court\\n - 6 -\\n limited circumstances. N.C. Gen. Stat. § 47E-5(b) (2020). When the disclosure is timely received, however, the purchaser’s right to cancel the contract is subject to the terms of the contract itself.\\n Furthermore, North Carolina law provides that “[o]ne who signs a written contract without reading it, when he can do so understandingly is bound thereby unless the failure to read is justified by some special circumstance.” Davis v. Davis, 256 N.C. 468, 472, 124 S.E.2d 130, 133 (1962).\\n Here, Defendant attended the “Open House” on 24 July 2017, where she was given both the Disclosure Statement and Agreement. Defendant had as much time as needed to review both documents. Defendant reviewed both documents, attested that she had received and examined Disclosure Statement by signing each page, including the pages upon which Items Number 27 and 33 appeared. Defendant voluntarily made an offer to purchase the property subject to the terms described therein and attested once again that she had received and reviewed a copy of the Disclosure Statement before signing the Agreement. When Defendant breached the Agreement by refusing to tender the Due Diligence Fee, her purpose for doing so was entirely unrelated to any perceived deficiency with regard to the Disclosure Statement. In fact, Defendant did not argue that the Disclosure Statement was invalid until well after litigation had commenced in this matter.\\n REYNOLDS-DOUGLASS V. TERHARK\\n Opinion of the Court\\n - 7 -\\n Defendant was given the opportunity to read and review both documents and she attested that she did so. She had the opportunity to ask for clarification, but she failed to do so. Defendant had no justification for any failure to read either document, nor the presence of any mistake, fraud, or oppression, nor any evidence that a special circumstance exists in this case which should operate to excuse any such failure. As such, the requirements of Chapter 47E were satisfied, and Defendant did not have the ability to terminate the Agreement. Defendant failed to show that there were any genuine issues of material fact that would have made summary judgment in Plaintiff’s favor an error. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in Plaintiff’s favor.\\n III. Attorney’s Fees\\n “Recovery of attorney’s fees, even when authorized by statute is within the trial court’s discretion and will only be reviewed for an abuse of that discretion. In order to demonstrate an abuse of discretion, the party challenging an award of attorney’s fees must show that the trial court’s ruling was manifestly unsupported by reason, or could not be the product of a reasoned decision.” In re Clark, 202 N.C. App. 151, 168, 688 S.E.2d 484, 494 (2009).\\n Defendant contends that the trial court committed reversible error in granting Plaintiff’s award for attorney’s fees and damages. Defendant does not challenge the\\n REYNOLDS-DOUGLASS V. TERHARK\\n Opinion of the Court\\n - 8 -\\n amount of the attorney’s fees award, only the award itself. After careful review, we affirm the trial court.\\n A. The Agreement\\n Paragraph 1(d) of the Agreement provides that the Due Diligence Fee of $2,000.00 is due “by the Effective Date,” in this case July 24, 2017. Paragraph 1(e) of the Agreement further provides that upon a breach of the Agreement by the buyer, the Earnest Money Deposit of $2,500.00 is to be “paid to Seller as liquidated damages as Seller’s sole and exclusive remedy for such breach, but without limiting . . . Seller’s right to retain the Due Diligence Fee.” Finally, Paragraph 1(e) provides that “If legal proceedings are brought by Buyer or Seller against the other to recover the Earnest Money Deposit, the prevailing party in the proceeding shall be entitled to recover from the non-prevailing party reasonable attorney’s fees and costs incurred in connection with the proceeding.”\\n When Defendant refused to deliver the Due Diligence Fee, she breached the Agreement. Plaintiff then sued to recover both the Due Diligence Fee and the Earnest Money Deposit. Since Plaintiff was required to institute a legal proceeding in order to recover the money, which included the Earnest Money Deposit, and prevailed, Plaintiff was entitled to recover attorney’s fees incurred in the proceeding. Id.\\n Our dissenting colleague argues that Plaintiff is not entitled to recover attorneys’ fees because she also sought to recover the Due Diligence Fee in the same\\n REYNOLDS-DOUGLASS V. TERHARK\\n Opinion of the Court\\n - 9 -\\n proceeding. Given language in the Agreement expressly providing for recovery of both the Due Diligence Fee and the Earnest Money Deposit as liquidated damages for breach by the buyer, we disagree with that analysis.\\n B. Statutory Authority\\n Generally, “a party may not recover it’s attorney’s fees unless authorized by statute.” Martin Architectural Prods., Inc. v. Meridian Constr. Co., 155 N.C. App. 176, 181 574 S.E.2d 189, 192 (2002). However, North Carolina law permits parties to “any note, conditional sale contract or other evidence of indebtedness” to recover attorney’s fees resulting from a breach of the same, “not in excess of fifteen percent (15%) of the outstanding balance owing.” N.C. Gen. Stat. § 6-21.2 (2020).\\n Our dissenting colleague argues this case falls outside the scope of Section 6-21.2 so that regardless of the terms of the Agreement, the trial court had no authority to award attorney’s fees.\\n In Stillwell Enter. v. Interstate Equipm. Co., 300 N.C. 286, 266 S.E.2d 812 (1980), our Supreme Court examined what constituted evidence of indebtedness. “The term ‘evidence of indebtedness’ as used in N.C. Gen. Stat. § 6-21.2 refers to any printed or written instrument, signed or otherwise executed by the obligor(s), which evidences on its face a legally enforceable obligation to pay money.” Id. at 294, 266 S.E.2d at 817.\\n Viewed in light of this definition, defendant’s lease agreement with plaintiff is obviously an “evidence of\\n REYNOLDS-DOUGLASS V. TERHARK\\n Opinion of the Court\\n - 10 -\\n indebtedness.” The contract acknowledges a legally enforceable obligation by plaintiff-lessee to remit rental payments to defendant-lessor as they become due, in exchange for the use of the property which is the subject of the lease. The contract . . . is in writing and is executed by the parties obligated under its terms. . . . Under these circumstances, we see no reason why the obligation by plaintiff to pay attorneys’ fees incurred by defendant upon collection of the debts arising from the contract itself should not be enforced to the extent allowed by [N.C. Gen. Stat. § 6-21.2.\\n Id. at 294-95, 266 S.E.2d at 818. Thus, in Stillwell, our Supreme Court held that a contract acknowledging a legally enforceable obligation constituted “evidence of indebtedness.”\\n In the present case, the Agreement was a printed instrument signed by both parties. The Agreement on its face evidenced a legally enforceable obligation for Defendant to pay the Due Diligence fee and Earnest Money Deposit to Plaintiff. We hold that, as in Stillwell, the Agreement served as “evidence of indebtedness” within the meaning of N.C. Gen. Stat. § 6-21.2.\\n The dissent argues that this case falls outside the scope of Section 6-21.2 because the sale of a residence by owner is not a commercial transaction, citing the “homeowner exception” to claims for unfair and deceptive trade practices. We are not persuaded that the exception should be extended to the application of Section 6-21.2, based on the text of the statute and its remedial nature. Section 6-21.2 provides for the recover of attorney’s fees “upon any note, conditional sale contract or other\\n REYNOLDS-DOUGLASS V. TERHARK\\n Opinion of the Court\\n - 11 -\\n evidence of indebtedness.” (emphasis added). The word “any” is inconsistent with an exception not otherwise provided in the same statute. See also Stillwell, 300 N.C. at 294, 266 S.E.2d at 817 (“[W]e hold that the term ‘evidence of indebtedness’ as used in [N.C. Gen. Stat. § 6-21.2 has reference to any printed or written instrument . . .which evidences on its face a legally enforceable obligation to pay money. Such a definition . . .accords well with its general purpose to validate a debt collection remedy expressly agreed upon by contracting parties.” (emphasis added)). And, as noted in Stillwell, Section 6-21.2 should be construed liberally by this Court because it is a remedial statute. Id. at 293, 266 S.E.2d at 817. As of the date of Defendant’s breach by refusal to pay the Due Diligence Fee, she owed Plaintiff $2,000.00 plus another $2,500.00 for an Earnest Money Deposit.\\n The award of attorney’s fees was authorized by both statute and the Agreement. There is no evidence to suggest that the trial court’s decision was manifestly unsupported by reason, or that the award could not be the product of a reasoned decision. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in granting Plaintiff’s award for attorney’s fees and damages, and thus, we uphold the decision of the trial court.\\n NO ERROR.\\n Judge INMAN concurs.\\n Judge MURPHY concurs in part, dissents in part.\\n Report per Rule 30(e).\\n No. COA20-112 – Reynolds-Douglass v. Terhark\\n MURPHY, Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\\n While I concur fully with the Majority’s conclusion in Part II that the trial court did not err in granting Plaintiff summary judgment, I respectfully dissent as to Part III regarding the award of attorney’s fees. If published, the Majority opinion would enact a sweeping change to the recoverability of attorney’s fees in North Carolina. This would be a change to public policy, and whether such a change is good or bad, it is a decision properly left to the General Assembly and not for this panel to make under the guise of statutory interpretation. N.C. CONST. art. I, § 6; id. art. II, § 1.\\n Generally, a party’s attorney’s fees are not recoverable. Martin Architectural Prods., Inc. v. Meridian Constr. Co., 155 N.C. App. 176, 181, 574 S.E.2d 189, 192 (2002). However, this common law principle is subject to statutory exceptions. Id. One such exception is N.C.G.S. § 6-21.2, which allows for the recovery of attorney’s fees up to 15% of the disputed amount when there is an obligation to pay attorney’s fees upon any note, conditional sale contract, or other evidence of indebtedness. N.C.G.S. § 6-21.2 (2019). However, N.C.G.S. § 6-21.2 is inapplicable here and thetrial court erred by ordering attorney’s fees to be paid as there was nothing in the Offer to Purchase and Contract (“Agreement”) to authorize the award and no statutory authority to support the amount of the award.\\n A.The Agreement Does Not Authorize Attorney’s Fees\\n REYNOLDS-DOUGLASS V. TERHARK\\n Murphy, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part\\n 2\\n The dispute between the parties involved only the due diligence fee. However, the Agreement only provides for the recovery of attorney’s fees by the prevailing party when either party initiates a legal proceeding to recover the earnest money deposit. Paragraph 1(d) of the Agreement contains the following provisions:\\n $2,000.00 BY DUE DILIGENCE FEE made payable and delivered to Seller by the Effective Date.\\n . . .\\n $2,500.00 BY (ADDITIONAL) EARNEST MONEY DEPOSIT made payable and delivered to Escrow Agent named in Paragraph 1(f) by cash, official bank check, wire transfer or electronic transfer no later than [14 August 2017], TIME BEING OF THE ESSENCE with regard to said date.\\n Further, paragraph 1(e) of the Agreement, in relevant part, allows for the recovery of attorney’s fees in a limited provision:\\n “Earnest Money Deposit”: The Initial Earnest Money Deposit, the Additional Earnest Money Deposit and any other earnest monies paid or required to be paid in connection with this transaction, collectively the “Earnest Money Deposit”, shall be deposited and held in escrow by Escrow Agent until Closing, at which time it will be credited to Buyer, or until this Contract is otherwise terminated. . . . In the event of breach of this Contract by Seller, the Earnest Money Deposit shall be refunded to Buyer upon Buyer’s request, but such return shall not affect any other remedies available to Buyer for such breach. In the event of breach of this Contract by Buyer, the Earnest Money Deposit shall be paid to Seller as liquidated damages and as Seller’s sole and exclusive remedy for such breach . . . If legal proceedings are brought by Buyer or Seller against the other to recover the Earnest Money Deposit, the prevailing party in the proceeding shall\\n REYNOLDS-DOUGLASS V. TERHARK\\n Murphy, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part\\n 3\\n be entitled to recover from the non-prevailing party reasonable attorney fees and court costs incurred in connection with the proceeding.\\n (Emphasis added). These paragraphs specify attorney’s fees will be recovered only when there is a legal proceeding to recover the earnest money deposit. When the trial court awarded Plaintiff “$13,067.70 as reasonable attorney’s fees incurred[,]” it was in response to the lawsuit brought by Plaintiff to recover the due diligence fee. The Agreement did not provide for attorney’s fees in an action such as this and therefore the order must be vacated. As the Agreement itself did not authorize the recovery of attorney’s fees in an action related to the due diligence fee, the trial court erred in awarding any attorney’s fees.\\n B. N.C.G.S. § 6-21.2 Does Not Apply\\n In quoting N.C.G.S. § 6-21.2, the Majority states “North Carolina law permits parties to ‘any note, conditional sale contract or other evidence of indebtedness’ to recover attorney’s fees resulting from a breach of the same, ‘not in excess of fifteen percent (15%) of the outstanding balance owing.’” Supra at 9. N.C.G.S. § 6-21.2 provides, in relevant part:\\n Obligations to pay attorney[’s] fees upon any note, conditional sale contract or other evidence of indebtedness, in addition to the legal rate of interest or finance charges specified therein, shall be valid and enforceable, and collectible as part of such debt, if such note, contract or other evidence of indebtedness be collected by or through an attorney at law after maturity, subject to the following provisions:\\n REYNOLDS-DOUGLASS V. TERHARK\\n Murphy, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part\\n 4\\n (1)If such note, conditional sale contract or other evidenceof indebtedness provides for attorney[’s] fees in somespecific percentage of the “outstanding balance” as hereindefined, such provision and obligation shall be valid andenforceable up to but not in excess of fifteen percent (15%)of said “outstanding balance” owing on said note, contractor other evidence of indebtedness.\\n (2)If such note, conditional sale contract or other evidenceof indebtedness provides for the payment of reasonableattorney[’s] fees by the debtor, without specifying anyspecific percentage, such provision shall be construed tomean fifteen percent (15%) of the “outstanding balance”owing on said note, contract or other evidence ofindebtedness.\\n N.C.G.S. § 6-21.2 (2019) (emphasis added). While the Majority accurately describesthis statute, it is inapplicable here.\\n 1.The Agreement Is Not a Note or Conditional Sale Contract\\n As a preliminary matter, the Agreement does not fall within the definition of a note or a conditional sale contract. A note is defined as “[a] written promise by one party . . . to pay money to another party . . . . A note is a two-party negotiable instrument. . . .” Note, BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY (11th ed. 2019). A conditional sale contract is “[a] contract for the sale of goods under which the buyer makes periodic payments and the seller retains title to or a security interest in the goods.” Conditional Sales Contract, Retail Installment Contract, BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY (11th ed. 2019). The Agreement is neither a note nor a conditional sale contract because it does not involve a negotiable instrument or the seller retaining title to the real property.\\n REYNOLDS-DOUGLASS V. TERHARK\\n Murphy, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part\\n 5\\n 2.The Agreement Is Not Evidence of Indebtedness\\n Our caselaw has previously defined “evidence of indebtedness” as used in N.C.G.S. § 6-21.2 to mean “a writing which acknowledges a debt or obligation andwhich is executed by the party obligated thereby.” Stillwell Enters., Inc. v. Interstate Equip. Co., 300 N.C. 286, 294, 266 S.E.2d 812, 817 (1980); see also State Wholesale Supply, Inc. v. Allen, 30 N.C. App. 272, 277, 227 S.E.2d 120, 124 (1976). In the case before us, the Majority characterizes the Agreement as “evidence of indebtedness” using the definition from a limited portion of Stillwell and holds N.C.G.S. § 6-21.2 applies to this agreement. Supra at 9-10. I disagree with this characterization of the Agreement and the application of N.C.G.S. § 6-21.2. I do not read Stillwell through the same lens as the Majority.\\n In Stillwell, our Supreme Court discussed the proper scope of the term “evidence of indebtedness” and held “[its] application must [] be gleaned from the context of the statute in which it appears and the factual circumstances surrounding the instrument or transaction to which it is sought to be applied.” Stillwell, 300 N.C. at 292, 266 S.E.2d at 816. While the Majority is correct in stating “[t]he term ‘evidence of indebtedness’ as used in [N.C.G.S.] § 6-21.2 refers to any printed or written instrument, signed or otherwise executed by the obligor(s), which evidences on its face a legally enforceable obligation to pay money[,]” the Majority applies this definition out of context. Supra at 9. The full passage reads:\\n REYNOLDS-DOUGLASS V. TERHARK\\n Murphy, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part\\n 6\\n [W]e hold that the term “evidence of indebtedness” as usedin [N.C.]G.S. 6-21.2 has reference to any printed or writteninstrument, signed or otherwise executed by the obligor(s),which evidences on its face a legally enforceable obligationto pay money. Such a definition, we believe, does noviolence to any of the statute’s specific provisions andaccords well with its general purpose to validate a debtcollection remedy expressly agreed upon by contractingparties. Viewed in light of this definition, [the] defendant’slease agreement with [the] plaintiff is obviously an“evidence of indebtedness.” The contract acknowledges alegally enforceable obligation by [the] plaintiff-lessee toremit rental payments to [the] defendant-lessor as theybecome due, in exchange for the use of the property whichis the subject of the lease.\\n Stillwell, 300 N.C. at 294, 266 S.E.2d at 817-18 (emphasis added). It is clear when reading Stillwell as a whole that N.C.G.S. § 6-21.2 applies to “supplement those principles of law generally applicable to commercial transactions” and is only relevant for commercial transactions. Id. at 293, 266 S.E.2d at 817. Under the Majority’s application of Stillwell, every contract where one party is to pay money would be evidence of indebtedness, an interpretation that is overbroad by its terms.\\n In Stillwell, the lease agreement at issue was a contract between two corporations for the lease of specific goods. Stillwell, 300 N.C. at 287, 266 S.E.2d at 813.The Agreement here is a form agreement created and approved by the NorthCarolina Association of Realtors, Inc. and the North Carolina Bar Association. According to the Guidelines for Completing the Offer to Purchase and Contract Form, the form is for use “in a variety of real estate sales transactions, but it was developed primarily for use in the sale of existing single-family residential properties. Do not\\n REYNOLDS-DOUGLASS V. TERHARK\\n Murphy, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part\\n 7\\n use this form as a substitute for a lease-option agreement, lease-purchase agreement or installment land contract.” GUIDELINES FOR COMPLETING THE OFFER TO PURCHASE AND CONTRACT, https://www.ncrealtors.org/wp-content/uploads/markup0717-2G.pdf (last visited Oct. 27, 2020). At no point in the terms of the Agreement is there an acknowledgment of a debt. The Agreement is not the same as an acknowledgement of debt, but rather a\\n basic agreement whereby [seller] agrees to sell and [buyer] agrees to purchase real property. . . . It is not a financing device, but rather contemplates that the [buyer] will pay the balance due on the property at the closing date, either by securing permanent mortgage financing or by simply using the [buyer’s] own funds.\\n James A. Webster, Jr., Webster’s Real Estate Law in North Carolina § 9.05 (Patrick K. Hetrick & James B. McLaughlin, Jr. eds., 6th ed. 2020). The Majority’s characterization of the Agreement as evidence of indebtedness is overbroad by its terms and I further dissent from its use of N.C.G.S. § 6-21.2 in this context.\\n 3. The Agreement Does Not Fall Within the Purpose of N.C.G.S. § 6-21.2\\n Further, on the basis of the intended purpose and function of the statute, the Agreement does not fall within the acknowledgment of debt nor the evidence of indebtedness definition. The general purpose of N.C.G.S. § 6-21.2 is to “validate a debt collection remedy expressly agreed upon by contracting parties.” Stillwell Enters., 300 N.C. at 294, 266 S.E.2d at 817-18. A contract to purchase residential real estate for personal use does not achieve this purpose. According to the drafter of\\n REYNOLDS-DOUGLASS V. TERHARK\\n Murphy, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part\\n 8\\n the boilerplate agreement, when the form was revised in 2010, the purpose of adding the attorney’s fees sentence to paragraph 1(e) was “the threat of additional costs will help dissuade persons who clearly are not entitled to the earnest money deposit from refusing to consent to its release to the other party.” 2010-2011 Update Course, Revised Offer to Purchase and Contract, Attorney Fees, NORTH CAROLINA REALESTATE COMMISSION, https://www.ncrec.gov/Pdfs/bicar/RevisedOfferToPurchaseAndContract.pdf (last visited Oct. 27, 2020). Incentivizing parties to not withhold a deposit they are not legally entitled to is not of the same caliber as a debt collection remedy. Therefore, the use of N.C.G.S. § 6-21.2 in the present case is inappropriate.\\n Even if the Agreement fell under the definition of evidence of indebtedness, N.C.G.S. § 6-21.2 still would not apply. The use of the word “upon” in the statuteindicates there must be an explicit obligation to pay attorney’s fees in the contract itself. In the Agreement, the obligation for attorney’s fees only relates to the specific term “earnest money deposit.” Therefore, even under N.C.G.S. § 6-21.2, the Agreement does not allow for recovery of attorney’s fees in any context other than the recovery of the earnest money deposit.\\n C.Amount of Attorney’s Fees\\n Even assuming, arguendo, N.C.G.S. § 6-21.2 applies to the due diligence portion of the Agreement, attorney’s fees would be capped at 15% of the due diligence\\n REYNOLDS-DOUGLASS V. TERHARK\\n Murphy, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part\\n 9\\n fee. Here, the due diligence fee was $2,000.00, 15% of which totals only $300.00. Therefore, Plaintiff’s attorney’s fees award would be limited to $300.00. The trial court’s award was unlawfully in excess of what would be statutorily authorized.\\n CONCLUSION\\n The trial court erred in awarding Plaintiff attorney’s fees. The attorney’s fees award should be reversed and vacated because there is no language in the Agreement to authorize the award, as well as no statutory authority to justify an award. Further, even assuming, arguendo, the award was authorized, attorney’s fees would be capped at $300.00. I respectfully dissent in part.\"\"\""

In  its  brief,  the  Board  contends  that  (1)  its \\n\\nappeal,  although  interlocutory,  is  properly  before  this  Court \\n\\n\\x0c-2- \\n\\nbecause  the  trial  court’s  order  amounted  to  a  rejection  of  the \\n\\nBoard’s  governmental  immunity  claim;  (2)  the  Supreme  Court  did \\n\\nnot  hold  in  Craig  v.  New  Hanover  Cty.  Bd.  Of  Educ.,  363  N.C. \\n\\n334,  338-42,  678  S.E.2d  351,  354-57  (2009),  that  state \\n\\nconstitutional  claims  may  rest  solely  upon  allegations  of \\n\\nnegligence;  and  (3)  Plaintiff  had  not  asserted  viable  state \\n\\nconstitutional claims against the Board in her complaint.  After \\n\\ncareful  consideration  of  the  Board’s  challenges  to  the  trial \\n\\ncourt’s  order  in  light  of  the  record  and  the  applicable  law,  we \\n\\nconclude  that  the  trial  court’s  order  should  be  reversed  and \\n\\nthat  this  case  should  be  remanded  to  the  Mecklenburg  County \\n\\nSuperior  Court  for  further  proceedings  not  inconsistent  with \\n\\nthis opinion. \\n\\nI. Factual Background \\n\\nOn  or  about  13  May  2011,  Plaintiff  Jane  Doe  filed  a \\n\\ncomplaint  seeking  to  recover  damages  from  Defendants  stemming \\n\\nfrom  sexual  abuse  that  she  suffered  at  the  hands  of  Defendant \\n\\nRichard  Priode,  her  band  teacher  at  South  Mecklenburg  High \\n\\nSchool.    According  to  Plaintiff’s  complaint,  Defendant  Priode \\n\\nmade  sexual  advances  towards  her  and  eventually  induced  her  to \\n\\nengage  in  various  types  of  sexual  activity,  including  oral  sex \\n\\nand  vaginal  intercourse,  with  him  both  on  and  off  school \\n\\ngrounds.    Defendant  Priode  was  later  arrested,  charged,  and \\n\\n\\x0c-3- \\n\\nentered  a  plea  of  guilty  to  taking  indecent  liberties  with  a \\n\\nchild as a result of his involvement with Plaintiff. \\n\\nIn  her  complaint,  Plaintiff  asserted  claims  against \\n\\nDefendant  Board  for  negligent  hiring,  supervision,  and \\n\\nretention;  negligent  infliction  of  emotional  distress;  and \\n\\nviolation  of  Plaintiff’s  rights  to  an  education  and  to  proper \\n\\neducational opportunities as guaranteed by N.C. Const. art. I, § \\n\\n15  and  N.C.  Const.  art.  IX,  §  1,  and  her  right  to  obtain  a  safe \\n\\neducation  as  guaranteed  by  N.C.  Const.  art.  I,  §  19.    According \\n\\nto  Plaintiff,  the  Board  should  have  recognized  the  signs  that \\n\\nDefendant  Priode  posed  a  threat  to  her  and  taken  action  to \\n\\nprevent  the  sexual  abuse  which  she  suffered  at  his  hands.    More \\n\\nspecifically, \\n\\nPlaintiff \\n\\nalleged, \\n\\nwith \\n\\nrespect \\n\\nto \\n\\nher \\n\\nconstitutional claims, that: \\n\\n40.  As  a  separate  and  distinct  cause \\nof  action,  Plaintiff  sues  the  Defendants  for \\nviolating  her  constitutional  rights  pursuant \\nto  North  Carolina  State  Constitution  in  the \\nfollowing particulars: \\n\\n \\na. \\n\\nViolation  of  Article  I[,] \\nSection  15  on  the  grounds  that  the  Defendant \\nallowed  the  conduct  as  alleged  in  this \\ncomplaint  and  that  this  conduct  deprived  the \\nPlaintiff  of  her  right  to  an  education  that \\nis free from harm: \\n\\n \\nb. \\n\\nViolation  of  Article  IX[,] \\nSection  1  in  that  the  Plaintiff  was  denied \\neducational  opportunities  free  from  physical \\nharm or psychological abuse; and \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c-4- \\n\\nc. \\n\\nViolation  of  Article  I[,] \\nSection  19  in  that  the  Plaintiff  has  been \\ndeprived  of  her  liberty,  interest  and \\nprivilege  in  an education  free  from  abuse  or \\npsychological  harm  as  alleged  in  this \\ncomplaint. \\n \\n\\n41.  This  constitutional  claim  for \\ndamages  is  pled  as  an  alternative  remedy, \\nshould  the  court  find  that  sovereign \\nimmunity  or  governmental  immunity  in  any  way \\nof  its  various  forms  exists  and,  if  it  does \\nexist,  in  that  event  Plaintiff  has  no \\nadequate  remedy  at  law  and  asserts  the \\nconstitutional  violations  pursuant  to  the \\nlaws of North Carolina. \\n\\n \\n\\nOn  27  June  2011,  the  Board  filed  a  partial  motion  to \\n\\ndismiss  pursuant  to  N.C.  Gen.  Stat.  §  1A-1,  Rule  12(b)(6),  in \\n\\nwhich  it  sought  the  dismissal  of  Plaintiff’s  constitutional \\n\\nclaims  on  the  grounds  that  Plaintiff’s  complaint  failed  to \\n\\nallege  facts  which  tended  to  establish  the  Board’s  liability  to \\n\\nPlaintiff  for  violating  the  various  constitutional  provisions \\n\\ncited  in  her  complaint.    On  the  same  date,  the  Board  filed  a \\n\\nsecond  partial  motion  to  dismiss  pursuant  to  N.C.  Gen.  Stat.  § \\n\\n1A-1,  Rules  12(b)(1)  and  (2),  in  which  it  sought  the  dismissal \\n\\nof  Plaintiff’s  negligent  hiring,  supervision,  and  retention  and \\n\\nnegligent infliction of emotional distress claims on the grounds \\n\\nthat the Board “enjoy[ed] full governmental immunity[.]” \\n\\nOn  22  August  2011,  the  trial  court  entered  an  order \\n\\ngranting  the  Board’s  motion  to  dismiss  Plaintiff’s  claims  for \\n\\nnegligent  hiring,  supervision,  and  retention  and  negligent \\n\\n\\x0c-5- \\n\\ninfliction  of  emotional  distress,  “since  the  Board  ha[d]  not \\n\\nwaived  immunity  by  the  purchase  of  liability  insurance.”  \\n\\nHowever,  the  trial  court  denied  the  Board’s  motion  to  dismiss \\n\\nPlaintiff’s  constitutional  claims  in  reliance  on  Craig.    After \\n\\nthe  trial  court,  at  the  Board’s  request,  certified  the  order \\n\\ndenying the Board’s motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s constitutional \\n\\nclaims  for  immediate  appeal  pursuant  to  N.C.  Gen.  Stat.  §  1A-1, \\n\\nRule  54(b),  the  Board  noted  an  appeal  to  this  Court  from  the \\n\\ntrial court’s order. \\n\\nII. Legal Analysis \\n\\nA. Appealability \\n\\nAs an initial matter, we must determine whether the Board’s \\n\\nappeal  is  properly  before  us.    Although  the  Board  acknowledges \\n\\nthat the trial court’s order is interlocutory in nature and that \\n\\nthe  trial  court’s  order  did  not  constitute  “a  final  judgment  as \\n\\nto one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties” that \\n\\nwas  immediately  appealable  pursuant  to  N.C.  Gen.  Stat.  §  1A-1, \\n\\nRule  54(b),  it  contends  that  the  trial  court’s  refusal  to \\n\\ndismiss  Plaintiff’s  constitutional  claims  affected  the  Board’s \\n\\nsubstantial right to governmental immunity.  We believe that the \\n\\nBoard’s argument has merit. \\n\\n“An  interlocutory  order  is  one  made  during  the  pendency  of \\n\\nan action, which does not dispose of the case, but leaves it for \\n\\n\\x0c-6- \\n\\nfurther  action  by  the  trial  court  in  order  to  settle  and \\n\\ndetermine  the  entire  controversy.”    Veazey  v.  Durham,  231  N.C. \\n\\n357,  362,  57  S.E.2d  377,  381  (citation  omitted),  r’hrg  denied, \\n\\n232  N.C.  744,  59  S.E.2d  429  (1950).    As  a  general  proposition, \\n\\n“there is no right of immediate appeal from  interlocutory orders \\n\\nand  judgments.”    Travco  Hotels  v.  Piedmont  Natural  Gas  Co.,  332 \\n\\nN.C. 288, 291, 420 S.E.2d 426, 428 (1992) (citation omitted). \\n\\nNonetheless,  in  two  instances  a  party  is \\npermitted  to  appeal  interlocutory  orders. \\nFirst,  a  party  is  permitted  to  appeal  from \\nan  interlocutory  order  when  the  trial  court \\nenters  a  final  judgment  as  to  one  or  more \\nbut  fewer  than  all  of  the  claims  or  parties \\nand  the  trial  court  certifies  in  the \\njudgment  that  there  is  no  just  reason  to \\ndelay  the  appeal.    Second,  a  party  is \\npermitted  to  appeal  from  an  interlocutory \\norder  when  the  order  deprives  the  appellant \\nof  a  substantial  right  which  would  be \\njeopardized  absent  a  review  prior  to  a  final \\ndetermination  on  the  merits.    Under  either \\nof  these  two  circumstances,  it  is  the \\nappellant’s  burden  to  present  appropriate \\ngrounds  for  this  Court’s  acceptance  of  an \\ninterlocutory \\nCourt’s \\nresponsibility to review those grounds. \\n \\n\\nappeal \\n\\nand \\n\\nour \\n\\nBullard  v.  Tall  House  Bldg.  Co.,  196  N.C.  App.  627,  637,  676 \\n\\nS.E.2d 96, 103 (2009) (citations and quotation marks omitted). \\n\\nAccording \\n\\nto \\n\\nwell-established \\n\\nNorth \\n\\nCarolina \\n\\nlaw, \\n\\ngovernmental  immunity  is  an  “‘immunity  from  suit  rather  than  a \\n\\nmere  defense  to  liability[.]’”    Craig,  363  N.C.  at  338,  678 \\n\\nS.E.2d  at  354  (quoting  Mitchell  v.  Forsyth,  472  U.S.  511,  526, \\n\\n\\x0c-7- \\n\\n105  S.  Ct.  2806,  2815,  86  L.  Ed.  2d  411,  425  (1985))  (emphasis \\n\\nomitted).    For  that  reason,  “[t]his  Court  has  held  that  denial \\n\\nof dispositive motions such as motions to dismiss . . . that are \\n\\ngrounded on governmental immunity affect a substantial right and \\n\\nare  immediately  appealable.”    Mabrey  v.  Smith,  144  N.C.  App. \\n\\n119,  121,  548  S.E.2d  183,  185  (citation  omitted),  disc.  review \\n\\ndenied, 354 N.C. 219, 554 S.E.2d 340 (2001); see also Craig, 363 \\n\\nN.C.  at  337,  678  S.E.2d  at  354  (stating  that,  although  the \\n\\n“[d]enial  of  a  summary  judgment  motion  is  interlocutory  and \\n\\nordinarily  cannot  be  immediately  appealed  . . .  the  appeal \\n\\n[before  the  Court]  is  proper  because  the  Board  raises  the \\n\\ncomplete  defense  of  governmental  immunity,  and  as  such,  denial \\n\\nof  its  summary  judgment  motion  affects  a  substantial  right”); \\n\\nMeherrin  Indian  Tribe  v.  Lewis,  197  N.C.  App.  380,  385,  677 \\n\\nS.E.2d  203,  207  (2009)  (recognizing  that  the  denial  of  a \\n\\ndismissal motion lodged pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1A-1, Rule \\n\\n12(b)(6), based on a claim of sovereign or governmental immunity \\n\\nis  immediately  appealable  because  it  affects  a  substantial \\n\\nright),  disc.  review  denied,  363  N.C.  806,  690  S.E.2d  705 \\n\\n(2010).    The  decisions  allowing  the  immediate  appeal  of \\n\\ndecisions  addressing  the  availability  of  sovereign  or \\n\\ngovernmental  immunity  hinge  upon  the  fact  that,  were  “‘the  case \\n\\nto  be  erroneously  permitted  to  proceed  to  trial,  immunity  would \\n\\n\\x0c-8- \\n\\nbe  effectively  lost.’”    Christmas  v.  Cabarrus  Cty.,  192  N.C. \\n\\nApp.  227,  231,  664  S.E.2d  649,  652  (2008)  (quoting  Slade  v. \\n\\nVernon,  110  N.C.  App.  422,  425,  429  S.E.2d  744,  746  (1993), \\n\\nimplicit  overruling  on  other  grounds  recognized  in  Boyd  v. \\n\\nRobeson  Cty.,  169  N.C.  App.  460,  470,  621  S.E.2d  1,  7,  disc. \\n\\nreview  denied,  359  N.C.  629,  615  S.E.2d  866  (2005)),  disc. \\n\\nreview denied, 363 N.C. 372, 678 S.E.2d 234 (2009). \\n\\nAlthough  Plaintiff  acknowledges  that,  in  the  event  that \\n\\n“the  trial  judge  [had]  denied  the  Board’s  motion  to  dismiss \\n\\n[P]laintiff’s  negligence  claims  based  on  governmental  immunity, \\n\\nthat  order  would  have  been  appealable  immediately,”  Plaintiff \\n\\nargues that, since Craig holds that governmental immunity is not \\n\\na  bar  to  constitutional  claims  such  as  those  that  Plaintiff  has \\n\\nasserted  in  this  case,  the  Board  is  not  entitled  to  rely  upon \\n\\ngovernmental  immunity  in  response  to  Plaintiff’s  constitutional \\n\\nclaims and that any decision to review the denial of the Board’s \\n\\ndismissal  motion  on  a  “limited  record”  like  that  before  the \\n\\nCourt  in  this  case  would  be  tantamount  to  the  unfair  and \\n\\nprejudicial  adoption  of  a  heightened  pleading  standard.    We  do \\n\\nnot find Defendant’s argument persuasive. \\n\\nThe record before us in this case clearly reflects that the \\n\\nBoard  asserted  governmental  immunity  in  its  responsive  pleading \\n\\nand  argued  that  Plaintiff  was  not  entitled  to  overcome  a \\n\\n\\x0c-9- \\n\\ngovernmental  immunity  bar  by  asserting  constitutional  claims \\n\\nthat  rested  solely  upon  allegations  that  the  Board  acted \\n\\nnegligently.  The fact that the trial court rejected the Board’s \\n\\nclaim  of  governmental  immunity  means  nothing  more  than  that  the \\n\\ntrial  court  found  that  Plaintiff  had  stated  one  or  more  viable \\n\\nconstitutional  claims.    Such  a  determination  does  not  mean  that \\n\\nthe  Board  is  not  entitled  to  governmental  immunity;  instead,  it \\n\\nmeans  that  the  same  determination  must  be  made  in  order  to  both \\n\\ndetermine  whether  we  are  entitled  to  hear  the  Board’s  appeal  on \\n\\nan  interlocutory  basis  and  ascertain  whether  Plaintiff  has,  in \\n\\nfact,  stated  a  claim  for  relief  against  the  Board  on  the  basis \\n\\nof  the  constitutional  provisions  upon  which  she  relies.    Thus, \\n\\nwe cannot determine the extent to which the Board is entitled to \\n\\nappeal the trial court’s order on an interlocutory basis without \\n\\naddressing  the  merits  of  its  challenge  to  the  trial  court’s \\n\\ndetermination that Plaintiff stated a claim for relief under the \\n\\nconstitutional  provisions  upon  which  she  relies.    The  mere  fact \\n\\nthat  Plaintiff  has  asserted  that  certain  of  her  claims  are \\n\\n“constitutional”  in  nature  does  not  automatically  mean  that  she \\n\\nhas  stated  one  or  more  valid  constitutional  claims  or  that  the \\n\\nBoard  is  not  entitled  to  avoid  liability  with  respect  to  those \\n\\nclaims,  properly  understood,  on  governmental  immunity  grounds.  \\n\\nMiller  v.  Rose,  138  N.C.  App.  582,  592,  532  S.E.2d  228,  235 \\n\\n\\x0c-10- \\n\\n(2000)  (stating  that,  in  addressing  motions  filed  pursuant  to \\n\\nN.C.  Gen.  Stat.  §  1A-1,  Rule  12(b)(6),  a  party’s  “[l]egal \\n\\nconclusions  .  .  .  are  not  entitled  to  a  presumption  of  truth”).  \\n\\nA failure to evaluate the validity of Plaintiff’s constitutional \\n\\nclaims  would  allow  Plaintiff  to  simply  re-label  claims  that \\n\\nwould  otherwise  by  barred  on  governmental  immunity  grounds  as \\n\\nconstitutional  in  nature,  effectively  circumventing  the  Board’s \\n\\nright  to  rely  on  a  governmental  immunity  bar.    In  other  words, \\n\\nin  the  event  that  we  were  to  hold  that  the  “Board  cannot \\n\\nimmediately  appeal,  it  will  have  to  litigate  [Plaintiff]’s \\n\\nnegligence  allegations,”  thereby  forfeiting  its  substantial \\n\\nright  to  rely,  in  appropriate  instances,  on  the  doctrine  of \\n\\nsovereign  immunity  in  response  to  Plaintiff’s  claims.    As  a \\n\\nresult,  we  conclude  that  the  Board’s  appeal  from  the  trial \\n\\ncourt’s order is properly before this Court. \\n\\nB. Plaintiff’s Constitutional Claims \\n\\nSecondly,  the  Board  contends  that  the  trial  court  erred  by \\n\\ndenying  its  motion  to  dismiss  Plaintiff’s  constitutional  claims \\n\\non  the  grounds  that  “[n]one  of  the  constitutional  provisions \\n\\ncited  by  [Plaintiff]  can  be  violated  by  negligence  alone.”    Put \\n\\nanother  way,  the  ultimate  issue  raised  by  the  Board’s  appeal  is \\n\\nwhether  Plaintiff  has  stated  a  claim  for  relief  based  upon  the \\n\\nrelevant  provisions  of  the  state  constitution.    After  careful \\n\\n\\x0cconsideration,  we  conclude  that  this  question  must  be  answered \\n\\n-11- \\n\\nin the negative. \\n\\n1. Standard of Review \\n\\n \\n\\n“We review a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim \\n\\nde novo.”  Bobbitt ex. rel. Bobbitt v. Eizenga, __ N.C. App. __, \\n\\n__,  715  S.E.2d  613,  615  (2011)  (citation  omitted).    In  making \\n\\nthat  determination,  we  must  ascertain  “‘whether,  as  a  matter  of \\n\\nlaw,  the  allegations  of  the  complaint  .  .  .  are  sufficient  to \\n\\nstate  a  claim  upon  which  relief  may  be  granted.’”    Farrell  v. \\n\\nTransylvania  Cty.  Bd.  of  Educ.,  175  N.C.  App.  689,  695,  625 \\n\\nS.E.2d  128,  133  (2006)  (quoting  Harris  v.  NCNB  Nat.  Bank  of \\n\\nNorth  Carolina,  85  N.C.  App.  669,  670,  355  S.E.2d  838,  840 \\n\\n(1987)).  In conducting the required analysis, we must “consider \\n\\nthe  allegations  in  the  [plaintiff’s]  complaint  [to  be]  true, \\n\\nconstrue  the  complaint  liberally,  and  only  reverse  the  trial \\n\\ncourt’s  denial  of  a  motion  to  dismiss  if  [the]  plaintiff  is \\n\\nentitled  to  no  relief  under  any  set  of  facts  which  could  be \\n\\nproven  in  support  of  the  claim.”    Id.

App.  30,  33,  681  S.E.2d \\n\\n465, 469 (2009) (citation and quotation marks omitted)). \\n\\n2. Applicability of Craig \\n\\nIn  determining  that  Plaintiff  had,  in  fact,  adequately \\n\\nstated  a  claim  for  relief  under  the  relevant  provisions  of  the \\n\\nNorth  Carolina  Constitution,  the  trial  court  appears  to  have \\n\\nconcluded  that  the  allegations  underlying  the  constitutional \\n\\nclaims  that  Plaintiff  has  asserted  here  are  identical  to  those \\n\\nat  issue  in  Craig  and  that  the  Supreme  Court  held  in  Craig  that \\n\\nsuch  allegations  sufficed  to  state  a  claim  for  relief  pursuant \\n\\nto  the  constitutional  provisions  upon  which  Plaintiff  relies.  \\n\\nWe  believe  that  the  trial  court’s  decision,  with  which  our \\n\\ndissenting colleague agrees, rests upon a misapprehension of the \\n\\nSupreme Court’s decision in Craig. \\n\\nIn  Craig,  the  plaintiff  sought  to  obtain  a  damage  recovery \\n\\nagainst the New Hanover County Board of Education based upon its \\n\\nfailure  to  protect  him  from  sexual  abuse  that  he  allegedly \\n\\nsuffered  at  the  hands  of  one  of  the  defendant’s  employees.    363 \\n\\nN.C. at 335, 678 S.E.2d at 352.  In his complaint, the plaintiff \\n\\nasserted  various  common  law  negligence  claims  against  the \\n\\n\\x0c-13- \\n\\ndefendant  and  also  alleged  that  the  defendant  “deprived  him  of \\n\\nan  education  free  from  harm  and  psychological  abuse”  in \\n\\nviolation of N.C. Const. art. I, §§ 15 & 19 and N.C. Const. art. \\n\\nIX,  §  1.    Id.    After  failing  to  persuade  the  trial  court  to \\n\\ngrant  summary  judgment  in  its  favor,  the  defendant  appealed  to \\n\\nthis  Court,  which  unanimously  reversed  the  trial  court’s \\n\\ndecision  with  respect  to  the  plaintiff’s  common  law  claims  on \\n\\ngovernmental  immunity  grounds.    Id.  at  335-36,  678  S.E.2d  at \\n\\n353.    In  addition,  by  a  divided  vote,  we  reversed  the  trial \\n\\ncourt’s  decision  with  respect  to  the  plaintiff’s  constitutional \\n\\nclaims  on  the  grounds  that  the  “plaintiff’s  common  law \\n\\nnegligence  claim  [was]  an  adequate  remedy  at  state  law.”    Id.  \\n\\nIn  other  words,  a  majority  of  this  Court  held  that,  even  though \\n\\nthe plaintiff’s common law negligence claims were clearly barred \\n\\nby  the  doctrine  of  governmental  immunity,  that  fact  did  not \\n\\nrender  those  claims  “inadequate”  for  purposes  of  determining \\n\\nwhether  the  plaintiff  was  entitled  to  assert  alternative \\n\\nconstitutionally-based  claims.    On  appeal,  the  Supreme  Court \\n\\nheld  that  the  “[p]laintiff’s  common  law  cause  of  action  for \\n\\nnegligence  [did]  not  provide  an  adequate  remedy  at  state  law \\n\\nwhen  governmental  immunity  [stood]  as  an  absolute  bar  to  [that] \\n\\nclaim,”  so  that  the  plaintiff  could  alternatively  advance  “his \\n\\ncolorable  claims  directly  under  our  State  Constitution  based  on \\n\\n\\x0c-14- \\n\\nthe  same  facts  that  formed  the  basis  for  his  common  law \\n\\nnegligence claim.”  Id. at 340, 678 S.E.2d at 355. \\n\\nIn  denying  the  Board’s  motion  to  dismiss  Plaintiff’s \\n\\nconstitutional  claims  in  reliance  on  Craig,  the  trial  court \\n\\nappears  to  have  concluded  that  Craig  contained  two  separate \\n\\nholdings,  one  of  which  relates  to  the  substantive  merits  of  the \\n\\nplaintiff’s  constitutional  claims,  instead  of  a  single  holding \\n\\nto  the  effect  that  a  common  law  claim  which  is  barred  by  the \\n\\ndoctrine  of  governmental  immunity  is  not  an  adequate  substitute \\n\\nfor  a  constitutionally-based  claim.    The  fundamental  problem \\n\\nwith  the  trial  court’s  logic  is  that  the  Supreme  Court  simply \\n\\ndeclined  to  consider  the  substantive  viability  of  the  state \\n\\nconstitutional  claims  that  the  plaintiff  attempted  to  assert \\n\\npursuant  to  N.C.  Const.  art.  I,  §§  15  &  19  and  N.C.  Const.  art. \\n\\nIX,  §  1,  in  Craig,  explicitly  stating  that  its  decision  did  not \\n\\n“predetermine  the  likelihood  that  [the]  [p]laintiff  [would]  win \\n\\nother  pretrial  motions,  defeat  affirmative  defenses,  or \\n\\nultimately  succeed  on  the  merits  of  his  case”  and  that  its \\n\\nholding  “simply  ensure[d]  that  an  adequate  remedy  must  provide \\n\\nthe  possibility  of  relief  under  the  circumstances.”    Id.    In \\n\\nother  words,  the  Supreme  Court  simply  held  in  Craig  that  the \\n\\nexistence  of  common  law  claims  that  were  barred  by  the  doctrine \\n\\nof sovereign or governmental immunity did not operate to bar the \\n\\n\\x0c-15- \\n\\nplaintiff  from  attempting  to  assert  any  constitutional  claims \\n\\nthat  he  might  have  otherwise  had  against  the  defendant  while \\n\\nexpressly  declining  to  address  the  extent  to  which  his \\n\\nconstitutional  claims  had  substantive  merit.

Feb.  23,  2010)  (holding \\n\\nthat  the  Supreme  Court  in  Craig  “simply  stated  that  the \\n\\nplaintiff  in  that  case  was  not  precluded  from  asserting  the \\n\\nstate  constitutional  claim,  without  reaching  the  merits  of  that \\n\\nclaim”).1  As a result, contrary to the conclusion reached by the \\n\\n                     \\n\\n1Admittedly,  the  Supreme  Court  made  several  references  to \\nthe  “colorable”  claims  asserted  by  the  plaintiff  in  its  opinion \\nin  Craig,  a  fact  which  seems  to  lie  at  the  heart  of  our \\ndissenting  colleague’s  belief  that  Craig  implicitly  addresses \\nsubstantive  constitutional  issues  in  addition  to  determining \\nwhether  the  existence  of  a  common  law  claim  that  is  clearly \\nbarred  by  governmental  immunity  precludes  the  assertion  of  a \\nconstitutionally-based  claim.    However,  the  absence  of  any \\nsubstantive  analysis  of  the  viability  of  the  plaintiff’s  claims \\nunder the relevant provisions of the North Carolina constitution \\ncoupled  with  the  Supreme  Court’s  explicit  statement  that  its \\ndecision  did  not  “predetermine  the  likelihood  that  [the] \\n[p]laintiff  [would]  win  other  pretrial  motions,  defeat \\naffirmative defenses, or ultimately succeed on the merits of his \\ncase,” Craig, 363 N.C. at 340, 678 S.E.2d at 355, indicates that \\nthe  Supreme  Court  did  not  intend  these  references  to  the \\nplaintiff’s  “colorable”  claims  to  be  tantamount  to  a  holding \\n\\n\\x0c-16- \\n\\ntrial  court  and  in  the  separate  opinion  submitted  by  our \\n\\ndissenting  colleague,  Craig  does  not  control  the  substantive \\n\\nissue  before  us  in  this  case,  resulting  in  the  necessity  for  us \\n\\nto  independently  determine  whether  Plaintiff  has  stated  a  claim \\n\\nfor  which  “relief  can  be  granted  under  some  [constitutionally-\\n\\nbased]  legal  theory.”    Bobbitt,  __  N.C.

Gillis,  158  N.C.  App.  48,  53,  580  S.E.2d  32,  36 \\n\\n(stating  that  “[t]his  Court  is  bound  by  precedent  of  the  North \\n\\nCarolina Supreme Court”), disc. review denied, 357 N.C. 508, 587 \\n\\nS.E.2d 887 (2003), our dissenting colleague advances a number of \\n\\ndifferent  arguments.    As  an  initial  matter,  our  dissenting \\n                                                                  \\nthat the allegations in the plaintiff’s complaint stated a valid \\nclaim  for  relief.    In  order  to  reach  a  contrary  determination, \\nwe  would  have  to  conclude  that  the  Supreme  Court  recognized  a \\nconstitutionally-based  liability  claim  sounding  primarily  in \\nnegligence  without  engaging  in  any  analysis  of  the  extent  to \\nwhich  that  outcome  was  appropriate,  an  outcome  which  we  believe \\nto be unlikely. \\n\\n \\n2Although  Plaintiff  argues  that  the  effect  of  our  decision \\nis  to  impose  a  heightened  pleading  requirement  upon  claims  such \\nas  those  that  she  is  attempting  to  assert  here,  the  ultimate \\nissue that we must address is, in reality, the exact contours of \\nthe  substantive  rights  created  by  the  constitutional  provisions \\nupon  which  Plaintiff  relies  rather  than  the  manner  in  which \\nclaims  arising  under  those  constitutional  provisions  should  be \\npled. \\n\\n\\x0c-17- \\n\\ncolleague contends that the only “dispositive difference between \\n\\nthis  case  and  Craig  is  that  Craig  was  decided  on  a  motion  for \\n\\nsummary  judgment  while  here  the  trial  court  ruled  upon \\n\\n[D]efendant[s]  .  .  .  12(b)(6)  motion.”    Although  we  agree  with \\n\\nour  dissenting  colleague  that  the  factual  allegations  relied \\n\\nupon  in  Craig  and  those  relied  upon  in  the  present  case  are \\n\\n“substantially  the  same”  and  that  this  difference  in  the \\n\\nprocedural  context  between  the  two  cases  does  not  justify  a \\n\\ndifferent  outcome  with  respect  to  the  merits  of  the  two  claims, \\n\\nthat  fact  does  not  have  any  real  bearing  upon  the  proper \\n\\nresolution  of  the  underlying  dispute  at  issue  here,  which  is \\n\\nwhether  Craig  contains  a  single  holding  relating  to  the  extent \\n\\nto  which  the  existence  of  a  common  law  claim  that  is  barred  by \\n\\nthe doctrine of governmental immunity precludes the assertion of \\n\\na  constitutionally-based  claim  or  whether  Craig  implicitly \\n\\naddresses  substantive  constitutional  issues  as  well.    Secondly, \\n\\nin  concluding  that  Craig  contains  an  implicit  substantive \\n\\nconstitutional  holding,  our  dissenting  colleague  emphasizes  the \\n\\nfact  that  the  Supreme  Court  in  Craig  reversed  our  decision  to \\n\\nthe  effect  that  summary  judgment  should  have  been  granted  in \\n\\nfavor  of  the  defendant  with  respect  to  the  plaintiff’s \\n\\nconstitutional  claims.    However,  this  argument  overlooks  the \\n\\nfact  that  we  had  held  that  summary  judgment  should  have  been \\n\\n\\x0c-18- \\n\\nawarded  in  favor  of  the  defendant  on  the  grounds  that  the \\n\\navailability  of  governmental  immunity  as  an  absolute  bar  to  the \\n\\nplaintiff’s  common  law  claims  did  not  suffice  to  render  those \\n\\ncommon  law  remedies  inadequate  for  the  purpose  of  determining \\n\\nwhether  a  constitutionally-based  claim  arising  out  of  the  same \\n\\nalleged  conduct  should  be  recognized,  not  that  the  substantive \\n\\nallegations  in  the  plaintiff’s  complaint  stated  a  valid  claim \\n\\nfor  relief  under  the  relevant  constitutional  provisions  or  that \\n\\nsummary  judgment  could  never  be  granted  in  that  case  under  any \\n\\ntheory.    Thirdly,  the  fact  that  the  Supreme  Court,  by \\n\\nessentially  rejecting  the  defendant’s  attempt  to  obtain  an \\n\\nappellate  decision  which,  in  essence,  would  have  recognized  a \\n\\ngovernmental  immunity  defense  to  constitutionally-based  claims \\n\\nwhich  bore  a  resemblance  to  recognized  common  law  claims, \\n\\nprovided  North  Carolina  trial  courts  with  “jurisdiction  to \\n\\nadjudicate  plaintiff’s  claims  fully,”  says  nothing  about  the \\n\\nextent,  if  any,  to  which  the  Supreme  Court  implicitly  held  that \\n\\nthe  allegations  set  out  in  the  complaints  at  issue  in  either \\n\\nthis  case  or  Craig  stated  a  viable  claim  for  relief  based  upon \\n\\nthe relevant constitutional provisions.  As a result, given that \\n\\nnone  of  the  arguments  advanced  by  our  dissenting  colleague  in \\n\\nsupport  of  the  trial  court’s  interpretation  of  Craig  strike  us \\n\\nas  persuasive,  we  will  proceed  to  determine  whether  the \\n\\n\\x0callegations  of  Plaintiff’s  complaint  do,  in  fact,  state  valid \\n\\nclaims  for  relief  predicated  upon  the  relevant  constitutional \\n\\n-19- \\n\\nprovisions. \\n\\n3. N.C. Const. art. I, § 15 and N.C. Const. art. IX, § 1 \\n\\nInitially,  Plaintiff  contends  that  the  Board’s  negligent \\n\\nacts  and  omissions  violated  her  “right  to  an  education  that \\n\\n[was] free from harm” and “psychological abuse” as guaranteed by \\n\\nN.C.  Const.  art.  I,  §  15  and  N.C.  Const.  art.  IX,  §  1.    N.C. \\n\\nConst.  art.  I,  §  15  provides  that  “[t]he  people  have  a  right  to \\n\\nthe  privilege  of  education,  and  it  is  the  duty  of  the  State  to \\n\\nguard and maintain that right.”  Similarly, N.C. Const. art. IX, \\n\\n§  1  states  that  “[r]eligion,  morality,  and  knowledge  being \\n\\nnecessary  to  good  government  and  the  happiness  of  mankind, \\n\\nschools,  libraries,  and  the  means  of  education  shall  forever  be \\n\\nencouraged.”    In  giving  content  to  these  constitutional \\n\\nguarantees,  the  Supreme  Court  has  held  that  North  Carolina \\n\\nstudents  are  entitled  to  receive  an  education  that  satisfies \\n\\ncertain  qualitative  standards.    Leandro  v.  State  of  North \\n\\nCarolina,  346  N.C.  336,  345,  488  S.E.2d  249,  254  (1997).    As  a \\n\\nresult,  the  Supreme  Court  has  recognized  that  a  student  is \\n\\nentitled  to  receive  “a  sound  basic  education  in  our  public \\n\\nschools,” including: \\n\\n(1)  sufficient  ability  to  read,  write,  and \\nspeak  the  English  language  and  a  sufficient \\n\\n\\x0c-20- \\n\\n(2) \\n\\nsufficient \\n\\nknowledge  of  fundamental  mathematics  and \\nphysical  science  to  enable  the  student  to \\nfunction  in  a  complex  and  rapidly  changing \\nsociety; \\nfundamental \\nknowledge  of  geography,  history,  and  basic \\neconomic  and  political  systems  to  enable  the \\nstudent  to  make  informed  choices  with  regard \\nto  issues  that  affect  the  student  personally \\nor  affect  the  student’s  community,  state, \\nand  nation;  (3)  sufficient  academic  and \\nvocational  skills  to  enable  the  student  to \\nsuccessfully \\npost-secondary \\neducation  or  vocational  training;  and  (4) \\nsufficient  academic  and  vocational  skills  to \\nenable  the  student  to  compete  on  an  equal \\nbasis  with  others  in  further  formal \\neducation \\nin \\ncontemporary society. \\n\\nemployment \\n\\ngainful \\n\\nengage \\n\\nor \\n\\nin \\n\\nId. at 347, 488 S.E.2d at 255. \\n\\n \\n\\nTo  date,  we  are  not  aware  of  any  decision  by  either  this \\n\\nCourt  or  the  Supreme  Court  which  has  extended  the  educational \\n\\nrights  guaranteed  by  N.C.  Const.  art.  I,  §  15  and  N.C.  Const. \\n\\nart. IX, § 1, beyond matters that directly relate to the nature, \\n\\nextent,  and  quality  of  the  educational  opportunities  made \\n\\navailable to students in the public school system.  Although the \\n\\nserious  wrongfulness  inherent  in  the  actions  in  which  Defendant \\n\\nPriode  allegedly  engaged  should  not  be  minimized  in  any  way,  we \\n\\nare  unable  to  see  how  the  allegations  set  out  in  Plaintiff’s \\n\\ncomplaint  state  a  claim  for  violating  these  constitutional \\n\\nprovisions.    Put  another  way,  we  are  unable  to  discern  from \\n\\neither the language of the relevant constitutional provisions or \\n\\nthe  reported  decisions  construing  these  provisions  that  North \\n\\n\\x0c-21- \\n\\nCarolina  public  school  students  have  a  state  constitutional \\n\\nright  to  recover  damages  from  local  boards  of  education  for \\n\\ninjuries  sustained  as  the  result  of  a  negligent  failure  to \\n\\nremain  aware  of  and  supervise  the  conduct  of  public  school \\n\\nemployees.    As  a  result,  Plaintiff’s  complaint  “on  its  face \\n\\nreveals  the  absence  of  facts  sufficient  to  make  a  good  claim” \\n\\nunder N.C. Const. art. I, § 15 or N.C. Const. art. IX, § 1, such \\n\\nthat  Plaintiff  has  failed  to  state  a  claim  based  on  those \\n\\nconstitutional  provisions  upon  which  relief  may  be  granted.  \\n\\nBobbitt,  __  N.C.  App.  at  __,  715  S.E.2d  at  615  (citation  and \\n\\nquotation marks omitted). \\n\\n4. N.C. Const. art. I, § 19 \\n\\nSecondly,  Plaintiff  asserts  that  the  Board  “deprived”  her \\n\\nof  “her  liberty,  interest  and  privilege  in  an  education  free \\n\\nfrom  abuse  or  psychological  harm”  as  guaranteed  by  N.C.  Const. \\n\\nart. I, § 19, which provides that: \\n\\n[n]o  person  shall  be  taken,  imprisoned,  or \\ndisseized  of  his  freehold,  liberties,  or \\nprivileges,  or  outlawed,  or  exiled,  or  in \\nany  manner  deprived  of  his  life,  liberty,  or \\nproperty,  but  by  the  law  of  the  land.

Const. \\n\\nart.  I,  §  19  “guarantees  both  due  process  rights  and  equal \\n\\n\\x0c-22- \\n\\nprotection  under  the  law”  and  has  been  interpreted  as  being \\n\\nsimilar to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to \\n\\nthe  Federal  Constitution.    Rhyne  v.  K-Mart  Corp.,  358  N.C.  160, \\n\\n180,  594  S.E.2d  1,  15  (2004).    As  a  general  proposition,  due \\n\\nprocess  “is  simply  not  implicated  by  a  negligent  act  of  an \\n\\nofficial  causing  unintended  loss  of  or  injury  to  life,  liberty, \\n\\nor  property.”    Daniels  v.  Williams,  474  U.S.  327,  328,  106  S. \\n\\nCt.  662,  663,  88  L.  Ed.  2d  662,  666  (1986)  (emphasis  omitted) \\n\\n(holding that the negligent act of a deputy sheriff which caused \\n\\ninjury  to  the  plaintiff  did  not  support  a  finding  of  liability \\n\\nbased  upon  the  due  process  clause,  so  that  the  trial  court \\n\\ncorrectly  granted  summary  judgment  in  defendant’s  favor  with \\n\\nrespect  to  a  due  process  claim  that  the  plaintiff  had  asserted \\n\\npursuant  to  42  U.S.C.  §  1983).    “Where  a  government  official’s \\n\\nact  causing  injury  to  life,  liberty,  or  property  is  merely \\n\\nnegligent,  ‘no  procedure  for  compensation  is  constitutionally \\n\\nrequired.’”   Id. at 333, 106 S.

Const.  art.  I,  §  19 \\n\\nentitles  Plaintiff  to  an  education  free  from  abuse  or  physical \\n\\nharm,  we  do  not  believe  that  she  is  entitled  to  a  damage \\n\\nrecovery  against  the  Board  based  upon  the  negligent  conduct \\n\\nalleged  in  her  complaint.4    As  a  result,  we  are  compelled  to \\n\\nconclude  that  “no  law  supports  [Plaintiff’s]  claim”  for  relief \\n\\nbased  upon  N.C.  Const.  art.  I,  §  19,  Bobbitt,  __  N.C.

Conclusion \\n\\nThus,  for  the  reasons  set  forth  above,  we  hold  that  the \\n\\nBoard’s  appeal  from  the  trial  court’s  order  denying  its  motion \\n\\nto  dismiss  Plaintiff’s  constitutional  claims  is  properly  before \\n\\nthis Court and that Plaintiff has failed to state claims arising \\n\\nunder  various  provisions  of  the  North  Carolina  Constitution  for \\n\\n                                                                  \\nnot  found  any  authority  tending  to  suggest  that  the  degree  of \\ninattention  to  Plaintiff’s  safety  alleged  to  have  occurred  in \\nthis  case  rises  to  the  level  of  a  violation  of  Plaintiff’s \\nrights  under  N.C.  Const.  art.  I,  §  19  and  do  not  believe  that \\ndeficient  supervision  of  the  type  alleged  to  have  occurred  here \\nsuffices  to  support  a  determination  that  Plaintiff  is  entitled \\nto  recover  damages  from  the  Board  under  the  “law  of  the  land” \\nclause. \\n \\n\\n4Our  dissenting  colleague  does  not  appear  to  disagree  with \\n\\nthis understanding of the relevant federal decisions. \\n\\n\\x0c-24- \\n\\nwhich  relief  may  be  granted.5    As  a  result,  the  trial  court’s \\n\\norder  should  be,  and  hereby  is,  reversed  and  this  case  should \\n\\nbe,  and  hereby  is,  remanded  to  the  Mecklenburg  County  Superior \\n\\nCourt  for  further  proceedings  not  inconsistent  with  this \\n\\nopinion. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nREVERSED AND REMANDED. \\n\\nJUDGE ROBERT C. HUNTER concurs. \\n\\nJUDGE STROUD dissents by separate opinion. \\n\\n \\n\\n                     \\n\\n5The  fact  that  Plaintiff  has  failed  to  state  a  claim  for \\nrelief  pursuant  to  the  constitutional  provisions  upon  which  she \\nrelies  does  not  mean  that  she  lacks  an  adequate  remedy.    “[T]o \\nbe  considered  adequate  in  redressing  a  constitutional  wrong,  a \\nplaintiff  must  have  at  least  the  opportunity  to  enter  the \\ncourthouse  doors  and  present  his  claim.”    Craig,  363  N.C.  at \\n339-40,  678  S.E.2d  at  355.    As  the  record  clearly  reflects, \\nPlaintiff  had  an  opportunity  to  present  her  claims  to  the  Court \\nand  obtain  a  determination  as  to  whether  those  claims  had  any \\nsubstantive  merit  without  having  to  overcome  any  sovereign  or \\ngovernmental  immunity  bar.    However,  since  Plaintiff  has  failed \\nto  state  viable  constitutional  claims  against  the  Board,  such \\nclaims,  to  the  extent  that  they  have  any  viability  under  the \\ncommon  law,  are  barred  by  governmental  immunity.    Although  our \\ndissenting  colleague  disagrees  with  this  assertion  and  argues \\nthat  the  plaintiff  in  Craig  had  no  more  opportunity  to  present \\nhis  claims  than  Plaintiff  has  had  in  this  case,  we  do  not  find \\nthis  argument  persuasive  given  that  it  rests  solely  upon  her \\nbelief that  Craig contains a substantive constitutional holding, \\nan  argument  which  we  have  not  found  persuasive  for  the  reasons \\nset forth above. \\n\\n\\x0c-25- \\n\\nNO.

Based upon Craig \\n\\nv.  New  Hanover  Cty.  Bd.  of  Educ.,  363  N.C.  334,  678  S.E.2d  351 \\n\\n(2009),  I  believe  this  Court  is  required  to  affirm  the  order  of \\n\\nthe  trial  court  denying  defendants’  motion  to  dismiss,  and \\n\\ntherefore I respectfully dissent. \\n\\n \\n\\nThe  majority  noted  correctly  that  “the  ultimate  issue \\n\\nraised  by  the  Board’s  appeal  is  whether  Plaintiff  has  stated  a \\n\\nclaim for relief based upon the relevant provisions of the state \\n\\n\\x0cconstitution[,]”  but  answers  this  question  “in  the  negative.”  \\n\\nThe majority relies upon its analysis of Craig, determining \\n\\n-26- \\n\\nthat \\n\\nthat \\n\\nclaims \\n\\nconstitutional \\n\\nthat  the  Supreme  Court  simply  declined  to \\nconsider  the  substantive  viability  of  the \\nstate \\nthe \\nplaintiff  attempted  to  assert  pursuant  to \\nN.C.  Const.  art.  I,  §§  15  &  19  and  N.C. \\nConst.  art.  IX,  §  1,  in  Craig,  explicitly \\nstating \\nnot \\n“predetermine  the  likelihood  that  [the] \\n[p]laintiff  [would]  win  other  pretrial \\nmotions,  defeat  affirmative  defenses,  or \\nultimately  succeed  on  the  merits  of  his \\ncase”  and  that  its  holding  “simply  ensure[d] \\nthat  an  adequate  remedy  must  provide  the \\npossibility \\nthe \\ncircumstances.”  Id. \\n    \\n\\ndecision \\n\\nrelief \\n\\nunder \\n\\nits \\n\\ndid \\n\\nof \\n\\n \\n\\nAlthough  it  is  certainly  true  that  the  Supreme  Court’s \\n\\ndecision  in  Craig  did  not  mean  that  the  plaintiff  in  that  case \\n\\nwould  ultimately  prevail,  the  Supreme  Court  did  “affirm  the \\n\\ntrial  court’s  denial  of  defendant’s  motion  for  summary \\n\\njudgment[,]”  thus  permitting  the  plaintiff  to  proceed  with  his \\n\\n“colorable  constitutional  claims”  based  upon  allegations  of \\n\\nnegligence.    Id.  at  340-42,  678  S.E.2d  at  355-57.    If  the \\n\\nSupreme Court did not consider  Craig’s “colorable constitutional \\n\\nclaims”  sufficiently  viable  to  survive  dismissal  at  the  summary \\n\\njudgment  stage,  it  would  have  reversed  the  trial  court’s  order \\n\\ndenying  the  defendant’s  motion  for  summary  judgment  since  the \\n\\nconstitutional  claims  were  the  only  claims  being  considered  in \\n\\nthe  Craig  appeal.    See  id.  at  336-42,  678  S.E.2d  at  353-57. \\n\\n\\x0c-27- \\n\\nThere was no dispute that the “negligence” claims were barred by \\n\\ngovernmental  immunity,  either  in  Craig  or  in  this  case,  thus \\n\\nleaving  only  the  constitutional  claims  for  consideration.    See \\n\\nid.  at  338,  678  S.E.2d  at  354.    The  difficulty  with  Craig  is \\n\\nthat  the  opinion  provides  no  meaningful  guidance  on  just  what  a \\n\\n“colorable  constitutional  claim[]”  based  upon  negligence  is, \\n\\nid.,  363  N.C.  at  334-42,  678  S.E.2d  at  351-57,  but  whatever  it \\n\\nmay  be,  if  one  existed  in  Craig,  the  same  claim  exists  in  this \\n\\ncase,  and  for  that  reason  the  trial  court  properly  denied \\n\\ndefendant Board’s motion to dismiss. \\n\\nI. \\n\\n“Colorable Constitutional Claims” \\n\\nThe  Supreme  Court  in  Craig  referred  to  the  plaintiff’s \\n\\nclaims  as  “colorable  constitutional  claims.”    Id.  at  342,  678 \\n\\nS.E.2d  at  357.    Defendant  Board  argues  that  “colorable \\n\\nconstitutional  claims[,]”  id.,  require  something  more  than  just \\n\\nan  ordinary  negligence  claim  which  has  been  given  an  alternate \\n\\ntitle  as  a  “constitutional  claim”  with  some  sections  of  the \\n\\nNorth  Carolina  State  Constitution  cited  in  support,  but  no \\n\\nfactual  allegations  which  would  actually  make  the  claim \\n\\nsomething  more  than  an  ordinary  negligence  claim.        Allowing \\n\\nsuch  a  claim  to  proceed  could,  as  a  practical  matter, \\n\\nessentially  eliminate  sovereign  or  governmental  immunity  in \\n\\nmost,  if  not  all,  ordinary  negligence  cases.    I  have  therefore \\n\\n\\x0c-28- \\n\\nexamined Craig, and its predecessor Corum v. University of North \\n\\nCarolina,  330  N.C.  761,  413  S.E.2d  276,  cert.  denied,  506  U.S. \\n\\n985,  121  L.Ed.  2d  431  (1992),  to  see  if  they  support  defendant \\n\\nBoard’s  argument  that  “colorable  constitutional  claims[,]” \\n\\nCraig,  363  N.C.  at  342,  678  S.E.2d  at  357,  which  may  survive  a \\n\\nmotion  to  dismiss,  require  more  than  allegations  of  negligence \\n\\ncoupled with the allegation that the defendant’s actions violate \\n\\nthe North Carolina State Constitution. \\n\\n1.  Craig’s Reliance on Corum \\n\\n \\n\\nI  can  find  no  definition  of  “colorable  claim”  in  the \\n\\ncontext  of  a  constitutional  claim  in  our  case  law,  but  Black’s \\n\\nLaw  Dictionary  defines  it  as  “[a]  claim  that  is  legitimate  and \\n\\nthat  may  reasonably  be  asserted,  given  the  facts  presented  and \\n\\nthe  current  law[.]”    Black’s  Law  Dictionary  282  (9th  ed.  2009).  \\n\\nAs  Black’s  definition  reveals  nothing  about  what  a  “colorable \\n\\nconstitutional  claim[]”  is,  Craig,  363  N.C.  at  342,  678  S.E.2d \\n\\nat  357;  Black’s  Law  Dictionary  282,  I  have  sought  guidance  in \\n\\nCorum.      In  contrast  to  Craig,  in  Corum,  the  case  upon  which \\n\\nCraig  relied,  the  plaintiff,  formerly  employed  as  a  dean  at \\n\\nAppalachian  State  University,  alleged  the  “defendants  discharged \\n\\nhim  from  his  deanship  in  retaliation  for  his  speaking  freely \\n\\nabout  the  moving  of  the  Appalachian  Collection[,]”  in  violation \\n\\nof his free speech rights, including those under “North Carolina \\n\\n\\x0c-29- \\n\\nConstitution  Article  I,  Sections  14,  19,  and  35[.]”  Corum,  330 \\n\\nN.C.  at  766-70,  413  S.E.2d  at  280-82;  see  Craig,  363  N.C.  at \\n\\n338-42, 678 S.E.2d at 354-57.  The Supreme Court determined that  \\n\\nour  common  law  guarantees  plaintiff  a  direct \\naction  under  the  State  Constitution  for \\nalleged  violations  of  his  constitutional \\nfreedom  of  speech  rights.    We  conclude  that \\nplaintiff  does  have  a  direct  cause  of  action \\nunder \\nagainst \\ndefendant  Durham  in  his  official  capacity \\nfor  alleged  violations  of  plaintiff's  free \\nspeech rights. \\n \\n\\nConstitution \\n\\nState \\n\\nthe \\n\\nCorum,  330  N.C.  at  783,  413  S.E.2d  at  290  (citation  omitted).  \\n\\nThus, in Corum, the constitutional claim was based upon specific \\n\\nfactual  allegations  of  an  intentional  act  of  the  defendant \\n\\nalleged  to  be  a  violation  of  a  constitutional  right,  the  right \\n\\nto freedom of speech.  See id. at 770, 413 S.E.2d at 282. \\n\\n \\n\\nYet  Corum  does  not  mention  the  concept  of  a  “colorable \\n\\nclaim.”    See  id.,  330  N.C.  761,  413  S.E.2d  276.    In  addition, \\n\\nthe Corum Court cited ten cases in support of its statement that  \\n\\nauthorities  in  North  Carolina  are  consistent \\nwith  the  decisions  of  the  United  States \\nSupreme  Court  and  decisions  of  other  state \\nsupreme  courts  to  the  effect  that  officials \\nand  employees  of  the  State  acting  in  their \\nofficial  capacity  are  subject  to  direct \\ncauses  of  action  by  plaintiffs  whose \\nconstitutional rights have been violated[;] \\n \\n\\nnone  of  these  ten  cases  address  negligence  claims  and  none \\n\\ndefine a “colorable claim.”  Id. at 783-84, 413 S.E.2d at 290.  \\n\\n2.  Craig’s Analysis \\n\\n\\x0c-30- \\n\\n \\n\\nTurning  back  to  Craig,  I  have  been  unable  to  discern  any \\n\\nfactual  allegations  which  would  establish  that  the  plaintiff’s \\n\\nconstitutional claim was a “colorable” claim based upon anything \\n\\nother  than  the  exact  same  allegations  which  supported  the \\n\\nnegligence  claims.    See  Craig,  363  N.C.  334,  678  S.E.2d  351. \\n\\nLegally,  Craig’s  analysis  and  holding  relied  specifically  upon \\n\\nCorum.  See Craig at 342, 678 S.E.2d at 356-57 (“In sum, we hold \\n\\nthat  plaintiff’s  common  law  negligence  claim  is  not  an  adequate \\n\\nremedy  at  state  law  because  it  is  entirely  precluded  by  the \\n\\napplication  of  the  doctrine  of  sovereign  immunity.  To  hold \\n\\notherwise  would  be  contrary  to  our  opinion  in  Corum  and \\n\\ninconsistent  with  the  spirit  of  our  long-standing  emphasis  on \\n\\nensuring  redress  for  every  constitutional  injury.”  (quotation \\n\\nmarks omitted)).  The Craig Court also noted that  \\n\\nour  holding  here  is  likewise  consistent  with \\nthe spirit of our reasoning in  Sale v. State \\nHighway  &  Public  Works  Commission,  242  N.C. \\n612,  89  S.E.2d  290  (1955),  and  Midgett  v. \\nNorth  Carolina  State  Highway  Commission,  260 \\nN.C.  241,  132  S.E.2d  599  (1963),  overruled \\non  other  grounds  by  Lea  Co.  v.  North \\nCarolina  Board  of  Transportation,  308  N.C. \\n603, 616, 304 S.E.2d 164, 174 (1983). \\n \\n\\nId. at 341, 678 S.E.2d at 356.  Both Sale and Midgett dealt with \\n\\nthe  taking  of  property  for  public  use.    See  Midgett,  260  N.C. \\n\\n241, 132 S.E.2d 599; Sale, 242 N.C. 612, 89 S.E.2d 290.  Neither \\n\\nSale  nor  Midgett  provides  any  guidance  as  to  the  identification \\n\\n\\x0cof  a  “colorable”  constitutional  claim  in  the  context  of \\n\\nnegligence.    See  Midgett,  260  N.C.  241,  132  S.E.2d  599;  Sale, \\n\\n-31- \\n\\n242 N.C. 612, 89 S.E.2d 290.   \\n\\n \\n\\nAs  to  the  factual  allegations,  in  Craig,  footnote  four \\n\\nstates  that  as  to  his  constitutional  claim  the  plaintiff \\n\\nalleged:   \\n\\nThe  constitutional  claim  for  damages  is \\nplead  [sic]  as  an  alternative  remedy,  should \\nthe  court  find  that  sovereign  immunity  or \\ngovernmental  immunity  in  any  of  its  various \\nforms  exists  and,  if  it  does  exist,  which \\nthe  plaintiffs  deny,  then,  in  that  event, \\nplaintiffs  have  no  adequate  remedy  at  law \\nand  assert  the  constitutional  violations \\npursuant to the laws of North Carolina. \\n \\n\\nId. at 340 n.4, 678 S.E.2d at 355 n.4 (quotation marks omitted). \\n\\nIt    appears  that  no  other  facts  or  circumstances  other  than \\n\\nthose  of  negligence  were  alleged  which  would  lead  to  the \\n\\nconclusion that  the plaintiff had made “colorable constitutional \\n\\nclaims.”    See  id.,  363  N.C.  at  334-42,  678  S.E.2d  at  351-57.  \\n\\nAlthough  Craig  did  not  explain  what  a  “colorable  constitutional \\n\\nclaim[]”  requires,  id.,  363  N.C.  at  334-42,  678  S.E.2d  at  351-\\n\\n57,  I  note  that  in  other  cases,  claims  which  have  been  treated \\n\\nas  constitutional  have  truly  been  grounded  in  facts  which \\n\\ndemonstrate  a  violation  of  a  constitutional  right,  and  not  mere \\n\\nnegligence claims to which the heading “constitutional” has been \\n\\nappended.  See, e.g., Sanders v. State Personnel Com'n, 183 N.C. \\n\\n\\x0cApp.  15,  644  S.E.2d  10,  disc.  review  denied,  361  N.C.  696,  652 \\n\\n-32- \\n\\nS.E.2d 653 (2007). \\n\\n3.  Federal Courts’ Approach \\n\\n \\n\\nGiven  the  lack  of  guidance  in  North  Carolina  cases  as  to  a \\n\\n“colorable  constitutional  claim[,]”  Craig,  363  N.C.  at  342,  678 \\n\\nS.E.2d  at  357,  based  upon  allegations  of  negligence,  I  have \\n\\nreviewed federal cases addressing this issue.  I find the United \\n\\nStates  Supreme  Court’s  treatment  of  governmental  immunity  in \\n\\ncases  which  allege  constitutional  violations  based  upon \\n\\nnegligent conduct to be instructive, as the Court has determined \\n\\nthat  a  mere  negligence  claim  is  not  transformed  into  a \\n\\nconstitutional  claim  merely  by  pleading  it  as  such.    See,  e.g., \\n\\nDaniels  v.  Williams,  474  U.S.  327,  88  L.Ed.  2d  662  (1986).    In \\n\\nDaniels, the United States Supreme Court considered the personal \\n\\ninjury  claim  of  a  prisoner  who  alleged  he  was  injured  when  he \\n\\nslipped and fell on a pillow negligently left on the stairs by a \\n\\ndeputy.    Id.  at  328,  88  L.Ed.  2d  at  666.    The  Court  noted  that \\n\\n“in  any  given  §  1983  suit,  the  plaintiff  must  still  prove  a \\n\\nviolation  of  the  underlying  constitutional  right;  and  depending \\n\\non  the  right,  merely  negligent  conduct  may  not  be  enough  to \\n\\nstate  a  claim.”    Id.  at  330,  88  L.Ed.  2d  at  667.    The  Court \\n\\ncontinued, \\n\\nThe \\n\\n \\nthe \\nFourteenth  Amendment  provides:  “[N]or  shall \\n\\nProcess \\n\\nClause \\n\\nDue \\n\\nof \\n\\n\\x0c-33- \\n\\nv \\n\\nof \\n\\nHudson \\n\\nPalmer, \\n\\ndestruction \\n\\nany  State  deprive  any  person  of  life, \\nliberty,  or  property,  without  due  process  of \\nlaw.”  Historically,  this  guarantee  of  due \\nprocess  has  been  applied  to  deliberate \\ndecisions  of  government  officials  to  deprive \\na  person  of  life,  liberty,  or  property. \\nE.g., Davidson v New Orleans, 96 US 97, 24 L \\nEd  616  (1878)  (assessment  of  real  estate); \\nRochin  v  California,  342  U.S.  165,  96  L  Ed \\n183,  72  S  Ct  205  (1952)  (stomach  pumping); \\nBell v Burson, 402 US 535, 29 L Ed 2d 90, 91 \\nS  Ct  1586  (1971)  (suspension  of  driver’s \\nlicense);  Ingraham  v  Wright,  430  US  651,  51 \\nL  Ed  2d  711,  97  S  Ct  140,  (1977)  (paddling \\nsupra \\nstudent); \\n(intentional \\ninmate’s \\nproperty).    No  decision  of  this Court  before \\nParratt  supported  the  view  that  negligent \\nconduct  by  a  state  official,  even  though \\ncausing  injury,  constitutes  a  deprivation \\nunder  the  Due  Process  Clause.    This  history \\nreflects  the  traditional  and  commonsense \\nnotion  that  the Due  Process  Clause,  like  its \\nforebear  in  the Magna  Carta,  see  Corwin,  The \\nDoctrine  of  Due  Process  of  Law  Before  the \\nCivil  War,  24  Harv  L  Rev  366,  368  (1911), \\nwas  “‘intended  to  secure  the  individual  from \\nthe  arbitrary  exercise  of  the  powers  of \\ngovernment,’”  Hurtado  v.  California,  110  US \\n516,  527,  28  L  Ed  232,  4  S  Ct    111  (1884) \\n(quoting  Bank  of  Columbia  v  Okely,  4  Wheat \\n235,  244,  4  L  Ed  559  (1819)).    See  also \\nWolff  v  McDonnell,  418  US  539,  558,  41  L  Ed \\n2d 935, 94 S Ct 2963 (1974) (“The touchstone \\nof  due  process  is  protection  of  the \\nindividual  against  arbitrary  action  of \\ngovernment,  Dent  v  West  Virginia,  129  US \\n114, 123 [32 L Ed 623, 9 S Ct 231] (1889)”); \\nParratt,  supra,  at  549,  68  L  Ed  2d  420,  101 \\nS  Ct  1908  (POWELL,  J.,  concurring  in \\nresult).    By  requiring  the  government  to \\nfollow  appropriate  procedures  when  its \\nagents  decide  to  “deprive  any  person  of \\nlife,  liberty,  or  property,”  the  Due  Process \\nClause  promotes  fairness  in  such  decisions. \\nAnd  by  barring  certain  government  actions \\n\\n\\x0c-34- \\n\\nregardless  of  the  fairness  of  the  procedures \\nused  to  implement  them,  e.g.,  Rochin,  supra, \\nit  serves  to  prevent  governmental  power  from \\nbeing  “used  for  purposes  of  oppression,” \\nMurray's  Lessee  v  Hoboken  Land  &  Improvement \\nCo.,  18  How  272,  277,  15  L  Ed  372  (1856) \\n(discussing  Due  Process  Clause  of  Fifth \\nAmendment). \\n \\nWe  think  that  the  actions  of  prison \\ncustodians  in  leaving  a  pillow  on  the  prison \\nstairs,  or  mislaying  an  inmate’s  property, \\nare  quite  remote  from  the  concerns  just \\ndiscussed.  Far from an abuse of power, lack \\nof  due  care  suggests  no  more  than  a  failure \\nto measure up to the conduct of a reasonable \\nperson.    To  hold  that  injury  caused  by  such \\nconduct  is  a  deprivation  within  the  meaning \\nof  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  would  trivialize \\nthe  centuries-old  principle  of  due  process \\nof law.  \\n \\n\\nId. at 331-32, 88 L.Ed. 2d at 668. \\n\\n \\n\\nAlthough  the  distinction  between  deliberate  conduct  and \\n\\nnegligent conduct is not always obvious, the United States Court \\n\\nof  Appeals,  Fourth  Circuit,  has  determined  that  there  must  be \\n\\nsome  element  of  intent,  and  more  than  negligence,  for  a \\n\\nconstitutional  claim  to  survive  immunity.    See  Lovelace  v.  Lee, \\n\\n472  F.3d  174,  201  (4th  Cir.  2006).    In  Lovelace,  the  Fourth \\n\\nCircuit  Court  vacated  summary  judgment  in  favor  of  the \\n\\ndefendants  because  there  was  a  genuine  issue  as  to  the \\n\\nplaintiff’s  allegations  that  the  defendant’s  actions  were \\n\\nintentional; the Court noted: \\n\\nThe \\n\\ndistrict \\n\\n \\nthe \\nanalysis  in  Daniels  and  Pink  to  Lovelace’s \\nFirst \\nclaim, \\n\\nAmendment \\n\\nextended \\n\\nexercise \\n\\ncourt \\n\\nfree \\n\\n\\x0c-35- \\n\\nthat \\n\\nheld \\n\\n935, \\n\\ncourt \\n\\n942–44 \\n\\nreasoning  that  the  operative  word  “prohibit” \\nin  the  First  Amendment  likewise  connotes  a \\n“conscious  act”  rather  than  a  merely \\nnegligent  one.    J.A.  171.    Accordingly,  the \\ndistrict \\nnegligent \\ninterference  with  free  exercise  rights  is \\nnot  actionable  under  §  1983.

Mitchell,  416 \\nF.Supp.2d \\n(S.D.Cal.2005); \\nShaheed,  885  F.Supp.  at  868.

Corp.  requires  discriminatory \\npurpose  in  order  to  establish  a  “denial”  of \\nEqual  Protection.  429  U.S.  252,  265,  97 \\nS.Ct. 555, 563, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977).  \\n \\nThe  language  and  the  purpose  of the  Due \\nProcess  Clause  thus  restrict  violations \\nthereof  to  official  conduct  that  entails \\nsome  measure  of  deliberateness.    Absent  such \\nlimitation,  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  would \\nbe  demeaned,  and  federal  courts  would \\nadjudicate  claims  that  lacked  connection  to \\nfederal  law.    In  our  system  of  governance, \\nthe  Constitution  is  revered  but  not \\nubiquitous,  and  federal  courts  sit  as  courts \\nof  limited  jurisdiction.    Thus,  as  Daniels \\nunderscores,  not  all  undesirable  behavior  by \\nstate  actors  is  unconstitutional.    See  Paul \\nv.  Davis,  424  U.S.  693,  701,  96  S.Ct.  1155, \\n1160,  47  L.Ed.2d  405  (1976)  (the  Fourteenth \\nAmendment  is  not  “a  font  of  tort  law  to  be \\nsuperimposed  upon  whatever  systems  may \\nalready be administered by the States’).  \\n \\n\\nPink  v.  Lester,  52  F.3d  73,  75  (4th  Cir.  1995).    Thus,  in  my \\n\\nview,  the  federal  courts’  requirement  of  some  element  of  intent \\n\\nor  deliberate  indifference  in  constitutional  claims,  see,  e.g., \\n\\nLovelace,  472  F.3d  at  201-02,  at  the  very  least,  should  be \\n\\nnecessary  for  a  negligence-based  “colorable  constitutional \\n\\nclaim[,]” Craig, 363 N.C. at 342, 678 S.E.2d at 357, under North \\n\\n\\x0cCarolina  law  as  well,  but  I  also  recognize  that  Craig  does  not \\n\\nappear to impose such a requirement.  See id., 363 N.C. 334, 678 \\n\\n-37- \\n\\nS.E.2d 351. \\n\\nII.  Interpretations of Craig \\n\\n \\n\\nThe  trial  court,  the  majority,  and  I  in  this  dissent  all \\n\\nagree  that  Craig  is  the  controlling  case;  unfortunately,  we \\n\\ndisagree  on  what  it  means  and  its  application  to  this  case.    I \\n\\nwill  therefore  attempt  to  address  our  areas  of  disagreement.  \\n\\nThe majority summarized, \\n\\n \\nIn  Craig,  the  plaintiff  sought  to \\nobtain  a  damage  recovery  against  the  New \\nHanover  County  Board  of  Education  based  upon \\nits  failure  to  protect  him  from sexual  abuse \\nthat  he  allegedly  suffered  at  the  hands  of \\none  of  the  defendant’s  employees.    363  N.C. \\nat  335,  678  S.E.2d  at  352.    In  his \\ncomplaint,  the  plaintiff  asserted  various \\ncommon  law  negligence  claims  against  the \\ndefendant  and  also  alleged  that  the \\ndefendant  “deprived  him  of  an  education  free \\nfrom  harm  and  psychological  abuse”  in \\nviolation  of  N.C.  Const.  art.  I,  §§  15  &  19 \\nand N.C. Const. art. IX, § 1.  Id.   \\n \\n\\n“The  Board  moved  for  summary  judgment”  which  the  trial  court \\n\\nsubsequently  denied;  the  Board  appealed.  Id.  at  335,  678  S.E.2d \\n\\nat  352-53.    This  Court  issued  an  opinion  by  a  divided  panel  as \\n\\nto  the  plaintiff’s  constitutional  claims.    Id.  at  336,  678 \\n\\nS.E.2d at 353.  The Supreme Court granted certiorari to consider \\n\\nplaintiff’s constitutional claims, noting that this Court’s  \\n\\n\\x0c-38- \\n\\nmajority  concluded  that  plaintiff’s  common \\nlaw  negligence  claim  is  an  adequate  remedy \\nat  state  law,  and  thus,  the  constitutional \\nclaims  are  barred.    The  dissenting  opinion \\ncontended  that  plaintiff’s  negligence  claim \\ncannot  be  an  adequate  state  remedy  since \\ngovernmental  immunity  completely  defeats  the \\nclaim.    By  an  order  dated  6  March  2008,  we \\ngranted  certiorari  to  review  the  Court  of \\nAppeals  decision  only  as  the  issue  raised  in \\nthe dissenting opinion. \\n \\n\\nId. (citation and quotation marks omitted). \\n\\n \\n\\nBefore the Supreme Court the  \\n\\n \\n[p]laintiff  argue[d]  that  his  common \\nlaw  negligence  claim  [wa]s  not  an  adequate \\nremedy  at  state  law  because  the  doctrine  of \\ngovernmental  immunity  prevails  against  it. \\nConsequently,  he  assert[ed]  that  per  this \\nCourt’s  decision  in  Corum  v.  University  of \\nNorth  Carolina,  330  N.C.  761,  413  S.E.2d \\n276,  cert.  denied,  506  U.S.  985,  121  L.  Ed. \\n2d 431 (1992), he should be allowed to bring \\nclaims  directly  under  our  State  Constitution \\nthat  will  not  be  susceptible  to  an  immunity \\ndefense. \\n \\n\\nId. at 338, 678 S.E.2d at 354. \\n\\n \\n\\nThe  Supreme  Court  noted  only  one  specific  allegation  made \\n\\nby the plaintiff which mentions a constitutional claim: \\n\\nThe  constitutional  claim  for  damages  is \\nplead  [sic]  as  an  alternative  remedy,  should \\nthe  court  find  that  sovereign  immunity  or \\ngovernmental  immunity  in  any  of  its  various \\nforms  exists  and,  if  it  does  exist,  which \\nthe  plaintiffs  deny,  then,  in  that  event, \\nplaintiffs  have  no  adequate  remedy  at  law \\nand  assert  the  constitutional  violations \\npursuant to the laws of North Carolina. \\n \\n\\n\\x0c-39- \\n\\nId. at 340 n.4, 678 S.E.2d at 355 n.4 (quotation marks omitted). \\n\\nNo  other  facts  or  circumstances  were  alleged  or  forecast  which \\n\\ncould  support  the  conclusion  that  the  plaintiff  had  made  a \\n\\n“colorable  constitutional  claim[].”    See  id.  at  334-42,  678 \\n\\nS.E.2d  at  351-57.    Nonetheless,  the  Supreme  Court  held  “that \\n\\nplaintiff’s  common  law  negligence  claim  is  not  an  adequate \\n\\nremedy  at  state  law  because  it  is  entirely  precluded  by  the \\n\\napplication  of  the  doctrine  of  sovereign  immunity.”  Id.  at  342, \\n\\n678  S.E.2d  at  356-57  (quotation  marks  omitted).    The  Court \\n\\nexplained that the \\n\\n[p]laintiff’s  remedy  cannot  be  said  to  be \\nadequate  by  any  realistic  measure.  Indeed, \\nto  be  considered  adequate  in  redressing  a \\nconstitutional  wrong,  a  plaintiff  must  have \\nat  least  the  opportunity  to  enter  the \\ncourthouse  doors  and  present  his  claim. \\nUnder  the  facts  averred  by  plaintiff  here, \\nthe  doctrine  of  sovereign  immunity  precludes \\nsuch  opportunity  for  his  common  law \\nnegligence  claim  because  the  defendant  Board \\nof  Education’s  excess  liability  insurance \\npolicy  excluded  coverage  for  the  negligent \\nacts  alleged.  Plaintiff’s  common  law  cause \\nof  action  for  negligence  does  not  provide  an \\nadequate \\nwhen \\ngovernmental  immunity  stands  as  an  absolute \\nbar  to  such  a  claim.  But  as  we  held  in \\nCorum,  plaintiff  may  move  forward  in  the \\nalternative,  bringing  his  colorable  claims \\ndirectly  under  our  State  Constitution  based \\non  the  same  facts  that  formed  the  basis  for \\nhis common law negligence claim. \\n \\n\\nremedy \\n\\nstate \\n\\nlaw \\n\\nat \\n\\nId. at 339-40, 678 S.E.2d at 355 (footnote omitted). \\n\\n\\x0c-40- \\n\\n \\n\\nIn  Craig,  the  plaintiff  alleged  he  was  sexually  assaulted \\n\\nat school.  363 N.C. at 335-36, 678 S.E.2d at 352-53.  Here too, \\n\\nthe  plaintiff’s  complaint  alleges  sexual  misconduct  at  school. \\n\\nIn Craig, \\n\\n[t]he  first  [claim]  was  based  on  common  law \\nnegligence.  His  other  claims  asserted  that \\nthe  Board  deprived  him  of  an  education  free \\nfrom  harm  and  psychological  abuse,  thereby \\nviolating  three  separate  provisions  of  the \\nNorth  Carolina  State  Constitution:  Article \\nI,  Section  15  (right  to  the  privilege  of \\neducation);  Article  I,  Section  19  (no \\ndeprivation  of  a  liberty  interest  or \\nprivilege  but  by  the  law  of  the  land);  and \\nArticle  IX,  Section  1  (schools  and  means  of \\neducation shall be encouraged).  \\n  \\n\\nId.  at  335,  678  S.E.2d  at  352.    Here  too,  plaintiff  brought \\n\\nnegligence-based  claims  against  her  school  board  based  upon \\n\\nallegations  of  negligent  hiring,  supervision,  and  retention  and \\n\\nnegligent infliction of emotional distress.  Plaintiff here also \\n\\nbrought  causes  of  action  under  the  exact  same  three \\n\\nconstitutional  provisions  as  the  plaintiff  in  Craig.    See  id.  \\n\\nIn  Craig,  the  plaintiff’s  constitutional  claims  were  based  on \\n\\nthe  same  facts  as  the  negligence  claims  without  any  additional \\n\\nallegations,  as  was  specifically  noted  in  Craig’s  holding.  See \\n\\nid.,  363  N.C.  at  340,  678  S.E.2d  at  355  (“But  as  we  held  in \\n\\nCorum,  plaintiff  may  move  forward  in  the  alternative,  bringing \\n\\nhis colorable claims directly under our State Constitution  based \\n\\non  the  same  facts  that  formed  the  basis  for  his  common  law \\n\\n\\x0cnegligence  claim.”  (emphasis  added)).        Here  too,  plaintiff \\n\\nmakes  no  factual  allegations  beyond  those  made  in  her \\n\\n-41- \\n\\nnegligence-based claims.   \\n\\n \\n\\nIn  Craig,  the  Supreme  Court  addressed  the  question  of \\n\\n“whether  plaintiff’s  common  law  negligence  claim,  which  will \\n\\nultimately  be  defeated  by  governmental  immunity  because  of  its \\n\\nexclusion  from  defendant  Board  of  Education’s  insurance \\n\\ncoverage,  provides  an  adequate  remedy  at  state  law[;]”  and  the \\n\\nSupreme  Court  held  “that  it  does  not  and  that  plaintiff  may \\n\\ntherefore  bring  his  colorable  claims  directly  under  the  North \\n\\nCarolina  Constitution.”    Id.  at  352,  678  S.E.2d  at  335.    The \\n\\nSupreme  Court  thus  “affirm[ed]  the  trial  court’s  denial  of \\n\\ndefendant’s  motion  for  summary  judgment  on  plaintiff’s  direct \\n\\ncolorable  constitutional  claims.”    Id.  at  342,  678  S.E.2d  at \\n\\n357.  Accordingly, I believe this Court is required here to also \\n\\n“affirm  the  trial  court’s  denial  of  defendants’  motion”  to \\n\\ndismiss  as  I  am  unable  to  distinguish  Craig  from  this  case  in \\n\\nany meaningful way.  Id. \\n\\n1.  Motion for Summary Judgment Versus 12(b)(6) Motion \\n\\n \\n\\nThe  only  potentially  dispositive  difference  between  this \\n\\ncase and Craig is that Craig was decided on a motion for summary \\n\\njudgment  while  here  the  trial  court  ruled  upon  defendant \\n\\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg  Board  of  Education’s  (“Board”)  12(b)(6) \\n\\n\\x0c-42- \\n\\nmotion.    See  id.    A  motion  to  dismiss  is  determined  upon  a \\n\\ndifferent standard than a motion for summary judgment.  See N.C. \\n\\nGen. Stat. § 1A-1, Rule 12(b)(6) (stating standard as “[f]ailure \\n\\nto  state  a  claim  upon  which  relief  can  be  granted”),  56(c) \\n\\n(2011)  (noting  that  a  motion  for  summary  judgment  should  be \\n\\ngranted \\n\\n“if \\n\\nthe \\n\\npleadings, \\n\\ndepositions, \\n\\nanswers \\n\\nto \\n\\ninterrogatories,  and  admissions  on  file,  together  with  the \\n\\naffidavits,  if  any,  show  that  there  is  no  genuine  issue  as  to \\n\\nany  material  fact  and  that  any  party  is  entitled  to  a  judgment \\n\\nas  a  matter  of  law”).    Considering  these  different  standards, \\n\\nthe  fact  that  the  Supreme  Court  found  that  the  allegations  in \\n\\nCraig  were  sufficient  to  survive  defendant’s  motion  for  summary \\n\\njudgment  necessarily  means  it  found  such  allegations  would \\n\\nsurvive  a  12(b)(6)  motion.    See  Craig,  363  N.C.  334,  678  S.E.2d \\n\\n351;  see  also  N.C.  Gen.  Stat.  §  1A-1,  Rule  12(b)(6),  56(c).  \\n\\nAfter  all,  if  the  plaintiff  had  “fail[ed]  to  state  a  claim  upon \\n\\nwhich  relief  [could]  be  granted”  then  the  defendant  necessarily \\n\\nwould be “entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.”  N.C. Gen. \\n\\nStat. § 1A-1, Rule 12(b)(6), 56(c). \\n\\n \\n\\nIn  addition,  even  though  Craig  was  decided  at  the  summary \\n\\njudgment  stage,  when  the  Court  may  consider  factual  allegations \\n\\nbeyond  the  pleadings,  see  N.C.  Gen.  Stat.  §  1A-1,  Rule  56(c), \\n\\nthe  Craig  opinion  is  not  based  upon  any  factual  allegations  of \\n\\n\\x0c-43- \\n\\nthis  type.    See  Craig,  363  N.C.  334,  678  S.E.2d  351.    The \\n\\nallegations  upon  which  the  Supreme  Court  relied  in  Craig  appear \\n\\nto  be  solely  from  the  complaint  and  are  substantially  the  same \\n\\nas  in  this  case.    See  id.    As  the  Supreme  Court  determined  that \\n\\nthe  plaintiff’s  allegations  in  Craig  were  adequate  to  survive \\n\\nsummary  judgment  under  Rule  56(c),  I  believe  we  must  conclude \\n\\nthat  these  same  claims  based  upon  such  similar  facts  must  also \\n\\nsurvive  defendant  Board’s  Rule  12(b)(6)  motion  to  dismiss.    See \\n\\nid.; see also N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1A-1, Rule 12(b)(6), 56(c). \\n\\n2.  Merits of the Plaintiff’s Case in Craig \\n\\n \\n\\nThe  majority’s  decision  seems  to  rely  primarily  upon \\n\\nlanguage in Craig which acknowledges that although the plaintiff \\n\\nhad  brought  a  “colorable  constitutional  claim[]”  which  was  not \\n\\nbarred  by  governmental  immunity,  the  plaintiff  in  Craig  may  not \\n\\nultimately prevail in his claim.  Craig, 363 N.C. at 340-42, 678 \\n\\nS.E.2d at 355-57.  The majority states, \\n\\nThe  fundamental  problem  with  the  trial \\ncourt’s  logic  is  that  the  Supreme  Court \\nsimply  declined  to  consider  the  substantive \\nviability  of  the  state  constitutional  claims \\nthat  the  plaintiff  attempted  to  assert \\npursuant  to  N.C.  Const.  art.  I,  §§  15  &  19 \\nand  N.C.  Const.  art.  IX,  §  1,  in  Craig, \\nexplicitly  stating  that  its  decision  did  not \\n“predetermine  the  likelihood  that  [the] \\n[p]laintiff  [would]  win  other  pretrial \\nmotions,  defeat  affirmative  defenses,  or \\nultimately  succeed  on  the  merits  of  his \\ncase”  and  that  its  holding  “simply  ensure[d] \\nthat  an  adequate  remedy  must  provide  the \\n\\n\\x0c-44- \\n\\nof \\n\\nunder \\n\\nrelief \\n\\npossibility \\nthe \\ncircumstances.”    Id.    In  other  words,  the \\nSupreme  Court  simply  held  in  Craig  that  the \\nexistence  of  common  law  claims  that  were \\nbarred  by  the  doctrine  of  sovereign  or \\ngovernmental  immunity  did  not  operate  to  bar \\nthe  plaintiff  from  attempting  to  assert  any \\nconstitutional  claims  that  he  might  have \\notherwise  had  against  the  defendant  while \\nexpressly  declining  to  address  the  extent  to \\nwhich \\nhad \\nsubstantive merit. \\n \\n\\nconstitutional \\n\\nclaims \\n\\nhis \\n\\nThe  majority  notes  that  Craig  was  not  a  decision  on  the  merits \\n\\nof  the  plaintiff’s  case.    Obviously  Craig  was  not  a  decision  on \\n\\nthe  merits  and  simply  affirmed  the  denial  of  defendant’s  motion \\n\\nfor  summary  judgment.    See  id.  at  342,  678  S.E.2d  at  357.    Not \\n\\neven  plaintiff  argues  that  the  absence  of  governmental  immunity \\n\\nmeans  that  she  will  ultimately  prevail  on  the  merits  of  her \\n\\nclaim;  she  claims  only  that  she  has  a  right  to  proceed  with  her \\n\\nconstitutional  claims.        The  pivotal  holding  in  Craig  is  that \\n\\ngovernmental  immunity  did  not  bar  the  plaintiff’s  claim  from \\n\\nproceeding past the summary judgment stage.  See id. at 342, 678 \\n\\nS.E.2d  at  356-57.    In  fact,  as  the  trial  court  would  have  no \\n\\njurisdiction  to  consider  a  claim  barred  by  governmental \\n\\nimmunity, see Meherrin Indian Tribe v. Lewis, 197 N.C. App. 380, \\n\\n384,  677  S.E.2d  203,  207  (2009)  (noting  that  while  it  may  be \\n\\nunsettled  whether  sovereign  immunity  is  based  upon  subject \\n\\nmatter  or  personal  jurisdiction,  it  is  a  jurisdictional  issue), \\n\\ndisc.  review  denied,  363  N.C.  806,  690  S.E.2d  705  (2010), \\n\\n\\x0c-45- \\n\\nCraig’s  holding  that  “plaintiff  may  move  forward  in  the \\n\\nalternative,  bringing  his  colorable  claims  directly  under  our \\n\\nState Constitution based on the same facts that formed the basis \\n\\nfor  his  common  law  negligence  claim”  meant  that  the  trial  court \\n\\ndid  have  jurisdiction  to  adjudicate  plaintiff’s  claims  fully. \\n\\nSee Craig, 363 N.C. at 340, 678 S.E.2d at 355. \\n\\n \\n\\nI  entirely  agree  with  the  majority’s  analysis  of \\n\\nplaintiff’s  constitutional  claims  under  N.C.  Constitution \\n\\nArticle  I,  Section  15;  Article  IX,  Section  1;  and  Article  I, \\n\\nSection  19;  I  simply  disagree  that  this  Court  is  at  liberty  to \\n\\nmake this analysis of the claims based upon Craig.  See id., 363 \\n\\nN.C.  334,  678  S.E.2d  351.    Craig  posed  the  question  of  whether \\n\\nthe  plaintiff’s  claim  should  survive  a  motion  for  summary \\n\\njudgment,  and  the  Supreme  Court  answered  this  question \\n\\naffirmatively  without  a  discussion  of  the  actual  merits  of  the \\n\\ncase.  See id.  As the majority points out,  \\n\\n \\nAccording  to  well-established  North \\nCarolina  law,  governmental  immunity  is  an \\n“‘immunity  from  suit  rather  than  a  mere \\ndefense  to  liability[.]’”    Craig,  363  N.C. \\nat  338,  678  S.E.2d  at  354  (quoting  Mitchell \\nv.  Forsyth,  472  U.S.  511,  526,  105  S.  Ct. \\n2806, 2815, 86 L. Ed. 2d 411, 425 (1985))[.] \\n \\n\\nAs  such,  if  a  claim  properly  barred  by  immunity  is  allowed  to \\n\\nproceed  beyond  a  motion  to  dismiss  or  for  summary  judgment,  a \\n\\nmajor  part  of  the  rationale  for  immunity  has  been  eliminated.  \\n\\n\\x0c-46- \\n\\nSee  id.  at  338,  678  S.E.2d  at  354.    If  a  case  is  allowed  to \\n\\nproceed  past  a  motion  to  dismiss  or  for  summary  judgment,  a \\n\\nsubstantial  part  of  the  protection  provided  by  governmental \\n\\nimmunity has been lost as the governmental entity must incur the \\n\\ncosts, both direct financial costs as well as the expenditure of \\n\\ngovernment  personnel  time  and  effort,  to  defend  the  case, \\n\\nregardless  of  whether  the  plaintiff  ultimately  wins  or  loses.  \\n\\nSee  id.    Based  on  the  strikingly  similar  facts  and  the  same \\n\\nlegal posture as in Craig, we too are asked to determine whether \\n\\nplaintiff’s  constitutional  claims  should  survive  a  pre-trial \\n\\nmotion;  in  light  of  Craig,  I  would  also  answer  the  question \\n\\naffirmatively.  See id., 363 N.C. 334, 678 S.E.2d 351. \\n\\n3.  Opportunity to Present Claim \\n\\n \\n\\nFurthermore,  the  majority  determines  that  plaintiff  here, \\n\\nby  virtue  of  bringing  her  claim  before  the  trial  court  and  this \\n\\nCourt “had an opportunity to present her claims to the Court and \\n\\nobtain  a  determination  as  to  whether  those  claims  had  any \\n\\nsubstantive  merit  without  having  to  overcome  any  sovereign  or \\n\\ngovernmental immunity bar” and thus had an adequate remedy.  But \\n\\nthe plaintiff in Craig had exactly the same opportunity, and our \\n\\nSupreme  Court  determined  that  “[p]laintiff’s  remedy  cannot  be \\n\\nsaid  to  be  adequate  by  any  realistic  measure.”  Id.  at  340,  678 \\n\\nS.E.2d at 355.  The Supreme Court went on to explain that due to \\n\\n\\x0c-47- \\n\\nthe  inadequate  remedy  and  “opportunity”  provided  by  the \\n\\nplaintiff’s  negligence  claim,  the  plaintiff  could  bring  a \\n\\nconstitutional  claim  “based  on  the  same  facts  that  formed  the \\n\\nbasis  for  his  common  law  negligence  claim.”    Id.  Thus,  the \\n\\nSupreme  Court  did  not  consider  the  plaintiff’s  remedy  to  be \\n\\n“adequate”  nor  did  it  determine  that  an  “opportunity”  was \\n\\nproperly  provided  for  the  plaintiff  “to  enter  the  courthouse \\n\\ndoors  and  present  his  claim.”    Id.    Under  the  similar  facts  and \\n\\nprocedural  posture  presented  in  this  case,  I  do  not  see  how  we \\n\\ncan  claim  that  plaintiff  here  had  a  realistic  “opportunity  to \\n\\nenter the courthouse doors” or an adequate remedy.  Id. \\n\\nIII. Conclusion \\n\\n \\n\\n “This  Court  is  bound  by  precedent  of  the  North  Carolina \\n\\nSupreme  Court[,]”  State  v.  Gillis,  158  N.C.

After  careful \\n\\nconsideration  of  Plaintiff’s  challenges  to  the  trial  court’s \\n\\norders  in  light  of  the  record  and  the  applicable  law,  we \\n\\nconclude that the trial court’s orders should be affirmed. \\n\\nI. Background \\n\\nA. Substantive Facts \\n\\nTimken  operates  a  “tapered  roller  bearing”  manufacturing \\n\\nplant  in  Randleman,  a  town  near  Asheboro.    Timken  personnel \\n\\nrefer  to  this  facility  as  the  Asheboro  plant.    Between  2006  and \\n\\n2010,  Sanders  Brothers  Inc.  provided  construction-related \\n\\nmaintenance  services  at  Timken’s  Asheboro  plant  and  several \\n\\n\\x0c-3- \\n\\nother  Timken  plants  pursuant  to  a  Master  Service  Agreement \\n\\n(MSA).    The  MSA  set  out  the  general  terms  and  conditions  which \\n\\nwould  apply  to  specific  contracts  into  which  Timken  and  Sanders \\n\\nmight  enter  in  the  future.    The  MSA  did  not  provide  for  the \\n\\nprovision of specific services or obligate either party to enter \\n\\ninto  specific  contracts;  instead,  the  MSA  provided  that  Timken \\n\\nwould execute Purchase Orders memorializing any  future contracts \\n\\nbetween the parties. \\n\\nIn \\n\\n2010, \\n\\nSanders \\n\\nexperienced \\n\\nserious \\n\\nfinancial \\n\\ndifficulties.    At  that  point,  Rick  Flickinger,  the  manager  of \\n\\nTimken’s  Asheboro  plant,  investigated  the  possibility  of \\n\\nprocuring  construction-related  maintenance  services  from  a \\n\\ndifferent  company.    In  the  course  of  that  process,  Crowder, \\n\\nwhich  competes  with  Plaintiff  in  the  construction  maintenance \\n\\nbusiness,  made  Mr.  Flickinger’s  “short  list.”    However,  after \\n\\nSanders  Brothers  assigned  its  rights  under  the  MSA  to  Plaintiff \\n\\neffective  on  9  June  2010,  Plaintiff  assumed  responsibility  for \\n\\nproviding  construction-related  maintenance  services  at  Timken’s \\n\\nAsheboro plant instead. \\n\\nAt  the  time  that  Plaintiff  began  providing  construction \\n\\nmaintenance  services  at  the  Asheboro  plant,  Mr.  Lanier  had  been \\n\\nemployed  at  that  facility  for  twelve  years,  with  the  last  six \\n\\nyears  of  that  period  having  been  spent  as  a  Sanders  Brothers \\n\\n\\x0c-4- \\n\\nemployee.    Mr.  Lanier  supervised  a  crew  consisting  of  three \\n\\nother  men  who  had  also  worked  at  the  plant  for  at  least  five \\n\\nyears  –  James  Moore,  Willard  McDaniel,  and  Earl  Turner.1    The \\n\\ncrew performed various tasks at the direction of Mr. Flickinger, \\n\\nincluding  welding,  metal  fabrication,  wiring,  repairing  the \\n\\nwater  pipes  and  coolant  system,  pipe  fitting,  and  performing \\n\\nother  machine  repairs.    In  addition,  Timken  had  a  “tendency  to \\n\\nrearrange  machines”  in  the  Asheboro  plant,  so  Mr.  Lanier’s  crew \\n\\nwas involved in implementing these “machine moves” as well.  The \\n\\nmachines  were  very  large;  moving  them  required  a  complex  series \\n\\nof  procedures  including  the  performance  of  some  construction-\\n\\nrelated work. \\n\\nAfter  Plaintiff  purchased  Sanders  Brothers’  rights  under \\n\\nthe  MSA,  it  hired  Mr.  Lanier  and  the  other  members  of  the  crew \\n\\nas  hourly,  at-will  employees.    Mr.  Lanier  continued  to  serve  as \\n\\ncrew  foreman  after  coming  into  Plaintiff’s  employment;  his \\n\\nimmediate  supervisor  was  Jack  Richardson,  one  of  Plaintiff’s \\n\\nGeneral  Managers.    As  crew  superintendent  and  Plaintiff’s \\n\\nhighest  ranking  employee  at  the  Asheboro  plant,  Plaintiff  had \\n\\nadditional responsibilities over and above those assigned to the \\n                     \\n\\n1Mr.  Lanier’s  crew  originally  included  a  janitor  named  Juan \\nEstrada.    However,  Crowder  did  not  hire  Mr.  Estrada  because  of \\nquestions  about  his  immigration  status.    As  a  result,  all \\nreferences to Mr. Lanier’s crew throughout the remainder of this \\nopinion  should  be  understood  as  encompassing  only  the  four \\nindividuals named in the text. \\n\\n\\x0c-5- \\n\\nother  crew  members.    Among  other  things,  Mr.  Lanier  supervised \\n\\nthe  crew,  coordinated  their  work  on  specific  projects,  and  had \\n\\nthe  right  to  select  crew  members  and  request  pay  raises.    Mr. \\n\\nLanier  also  had  certain  record-keeping  responsibilities, \\n\\nincluding  documenting  compliance  with  safety  regulations, \\n\\noverseeing  weekly  employee  time  sheets,  and  preparing  documents \\n\\nthat  Plaintiff  used  to  generate  invoices  and  prepare  other \\n\\nreports.    Finally,  Mr.  Lanier  functioned  as  the  primary  source \\n\\nof  communication  between  his  crew  and  the  individuals  directly \\n\\nresponsible for  operating Timken’s Asheboro plant and Plaintiff.  \\n\\nMr.  Lanier  did  not  work  from  an  office;  instead,  he  performed \\n\\nhis supervisory tasks while working with the rest of the crew on \\n\\nconstruction-related  maintenance  projects.    Neither  Mr.  Lanier \\n\\nnor  any  other  member  of  the  crew  was  asked  to  sign  a  non-\\n\\ncompetition  agreement,  a  non-solicitation  agreement,  or  a \\n\\nconfidentiality agreement. \\n\\nWithin  a  month  after  becoming  employed  by  Plaintiff,  the \\n\\nmembers of the crew became dissatisfied with the manner in which \\n\\nPlaintiff  handled  certain  administrative  issues,  the  amount  of \\n\\npaperwork  that  Plaintiff  required,  and  the  manner  in  which \\n\\nPlaintiff  responded  to  their  concerns.    As  a  result,  all  four \\n\\ncrew  members  began  looking  for  other  employment  during  the \\n\\nsummer of 2010. \\n\\n\\x0c-6- \\n\\nOn  14  July  2010,  James  Moore  called  Brian  Gossett,  a \\n\\nCrowder employee with whom James Moore had worked when both were \\n\\nemployed  by  Sanders  Brothers  at  the  Asheboro  plant.    At  that \\n\\ntime,  James  Moore,  who  wanted  to  “get  away  from  [Plaintiff],” \\n\\nasked  Mr.  Gossett  if  he  might  obtain  employment  at  Crowder.  \\n\\nAfter  Mr.  Gossett  indicated  that  Crowder  was  always  looking  for \\n\\ngood  workers,  James  Moore  gave  him  Mr.  Lanier’s  phone  number.  \\n\\nMr.  Gossett,  in  turn,  agreed  to  provide  Mr.  Lanier’s  phone \\n\\nnumber  to  Tracy  Moore,  who  held  a  management  position  with \\n\\nCrowder. \\n\\nOn  the  following  day,  Tracy  Moore  called  Mr.  Lanier.    At \\n\\nthat  time,  Mr.  Lanier  and  Tracy  Moore  discussed  the  possibility \\n\\nthat  Mr.  Lanier’s  entire  crew  would  begin  working  for  Crowder.  \\n\\nDuring  that  conversation,  Mr.  Lanier  asked  Tracy  Moore  to  send \\n\\nhim  information  concerning  the  salary  and  benefit  package  that \\n\\nCrowder would be in a position to offer to members of the crew. \\n\\nMr. Lanier also talked to Mr. Flickinger about the possible \\n\\nchange.  Among other things, Mr. Lanier told Mr. Flickinger that \\n\\nhe  did  not  want  to  continue  working  for  Plaintiff  and  that  the \\n\\ncrew  complained  about  Plaintiff  “several  times  a  week.”    After \\n\\nspeaking  with  his  supervisors,  Mr.  Flickinger  informed  Mr. \\n\\nLanier  that,  instead  of  being  contractually  obligated  to  work \\n\\nwith  Plaintiff,  Timken \\n\\nwas  free  to  procure  specific \\n\\n\\x0c-7- \\n\\nconstruction-related  maintenance  services  from  Crowder  rather \\n\\nthan  Plaintiff.    In  addition,  Mr.  Flickinger  told  Mr.  Lanier \\n\\nthat  he  would  like  the  crew  to  stay  at  the  Asheboro  plant \\n\\nregardless  of  whether  they  were  employed  by  Plaintiff,  Crowder, \\n\\nor  some  other  company.    After  receiving  this  information, \\n\\nCrowder  provided  salary  and  benefits  information  to  Mr.  Lanier, \\n\\nsubmitted  a  proposal  under  which  Crowder  would  perform  work  at \\n\\nTimken’s  Asheboro  plant  to  Mr.  Flickinger,  and  completed  the \\n\\ndocumentation  required  for  Crowder  to  become  qualified  to \\n\\nprovide  construction-related  maintenance  services  at  the \\n\\nAsheboro plant. \\n\\nBetween  July  and  October  of  2010,  the  crew  had  frequent \\n\\ndiscussions  concerning  their  dissatisfaction  with  Plaintiff  and \\n\\nthe  possibility  that  they  might  begin  working  for  Crowder \\n\\ninstead.    On  23  August  2010,  Mr.  Richardson  received  an  email \\n\\nfrom  Caleb  Rice,  one  of  Plaintiff’s  safety  managers,  in  which \\n\\nMr. Rice stated that: \\n\\nI  just  wanted  to  send  you  guys  a  note \\nreflecting  on  my  visit  with  Steve  Lanier  at \\nTimken  Asheboro  last  week.  . . .    I  would \\nregret  not  letting  you  know  the  concerns \\nthat  Steve  has  voiced  to  me,  and  knowing \\nSteve  as  a  very  honest  and  straightforward \\nperson,  these  are  not  idle  threats.  . . . \\nSteve  is  looking  at  other  contactors  to  work \\nfor  in  the  Timken  Asheboro  plant,  and  right \\nnow  the  only  thing  stalling  the  change  is \\nwhich  company  will  offer  the  best  pay  and \\nbenefits.    First  of  all,  Steve  says  that  he \\n\\n\\x0c-8- \\n\\ndoes  not  want  to  change  companies,  he  feels \\nthat  they  have  been  through  enough  without \\nhaving  to  go  through  another  change,  but  the \\ncrew  up  there  will  not  continue working  with \\nall of these issues.  The following are some \\nof  the  issues  that  he  has  had  over  the  last \\ntwo months. . . . . \\n \\n\\nOn  the  following  day,  Mr.  Richardson  traveled  to  the  Asheboro \\n\\nplant  and  met  with  Mr.  Lanier,  Mr.  Flickinger,  and  the  other \\n\\nmembers  of  the  crew  for  the  purpose  of  discussing  issues  that \\n\\nwere  of  concern  to  the  crew.    However,  the  crew  continued  to  be \\n\\ndissatisfied with their status as employees of Plaintiff. \\n\\nOn  27  September  2010,  the  members  of  the  crew  met  with \\n\\nTracy  Moore  to  discuss  working  for  Crowder.    Although  the \\n\\nbenefits  offered  by  Crowder  were  not  as  favorable  as  those \\n\\nalready  provided  by  Plaintiff,  the  entire  crew  decided  to  quit \\n\\nworking  for  Plaintiff  and  to  go  to  work  for  Crowder.    As  a \\n\\nresult,  on  7  October  2010,  the  crew  traveled  to  Crowder’s \\n\\nSpartanburg,  South  Carolina,  office,  where  they  completed  job \\n\\napplications  and  were  hired  to  work  for  Crowder  beginning  on  18 \\n\\nOctober 2010. \\n\\nThe  crew  was  involved  in  moving  a  very  large  and  complex \\n\\nmachine  during  the  following  week.    On  14  October  2010,  which \\n\\nwas  a  Thursday,  they  worked  three  hours  overtime  in  order  to \\n\\nmake  sure  that  the  machine  move  had  been  sufficiently  completed \\n\\nthat  a  regular  Timken  employee  or  contractor  could  finish  the \\n\\n\\x0c-9- \\n\\njob  without  a  loss  of  production  capability  if  something \\n\\nprevented  the  crew  from  returning  on  Monday  as  Crowder \\n\\nemployees.    After  finishing  work  on  14  October  2010,  Mr.  Lanier \\n\\ncalled  Mr.  Richardson  and  informed  him  that  he,  Mr.  McDaniel, \\n\\nMr.  Turner,  and  Mr.  Moore  were  resigning.    On  the  following \\n\\nMonday,  18  October  2010,  Mr.  Lanier  and  the  other  crew  members \\n\\nreturned to work at the Asheboro plant as Crowder employees. \\n\\nB. Procedural History \\n\\nOn 3 November 2010, Plaintiff filed a complaint in which it \\n\\nsought  damages  from  both  Defendants  based  on  claims  sounding  in \\n\\ntortious  interference  with  contractual  relations,  unfair  or \\n\\ndeceptive  trade  practices,  and  civil  conspiracy  and  an \\n\\nadditional  claim  against  Mr.  Lanier  for  breach  of  fiduciary \\n\\nduty.  In addition, Plaintiff sought the issuance of a permanent \\n\\ninjunction  barring  Crowder  from  providing  construction-related \\n\\nmaintenance  services  at  the  Asheboro  plant.    On  3  January  2011, \\n\\nDefendants  filed  separate  answers  in  which  they  denied  the \\n\\nmaterial  allegations  of  Plaintiff’s  complaint;  asserted  various \\n\\naffirmative  defenses;  sought  dismissal  of  Plaintiff’s  complaint \\n\\npursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1A-1, Rule 12(b)(6); and requested \\n\\nan award of attorneys’ fees.  On 20 April 2011, Judge Richard D. \\n\\nBoner entered an order denying Defendants’ dismissal motions and \\n\\nallowing Plaintiff’s request to amend its complaint. \\n\\n\\x0c-10- \\n\\nOn  26  April  2011,  Plaintiff  filed  an  amended  complaint  in \\n\\nwhich  it  asserted  the  same  claims  that  had  been  asserted  in  its \\n\\noriginal  complaint.    In  essence,  Plaintiff  alleged  that \\n\\nDefendants  had  “knowingly  conspired”  to  “implement  a  predatory \\n\\nscheme” by which the crew would resign “en masse” in “the middle \\n\\nof  a  critical  machine  move”  on  14  October  2010  and  that,  given \\n\\nthat set of circumstances, Mr. Flickinger “had no choice” but to \\n\\nuse  Mr.  Lanier’s  crew,  in  their  capacity  as  Crowder  employees, \\n\\nfor needed construction-related maintenance services.  On 1 June \\n\\n2011, Defendants filed answers in which they denied the material \\n\\nallegations  of  the  amended  complaint,  asserted  various \\n\\naffirmative defenses, sought dismissal of Plaintiff’s claims for \\n\\nfailure  to  state  a  claim  for  which  relief  could  be  granted,  and \\n\\nrequested an award of attorneys’ fees. \\n\\nOn  2  September  2011,  Defendants  filed  motions  seeking  the \\n\\nentry  of  summary  judgment  in  their  favor  with  respect  to  all  of \\n\\nPlaintiff’s claims.  The trial court conducted a hearing for the \\n\\npurpose  of  addressing  the  issues  raised  by  Defendants’  summary \\n\\njudgment  motions  on  14  September  2011.    On  2  November  2011,  the \\n\\ntrial  court  entered  summary  judgment  orders  in  favor  of \\n\\nDefendants  with  respect  to  all  of  the  claims  that  had  been \\n\\nasserted  in  the  amended  complaint.    Plaintiff  noted  a  timely \\n\\nappeal to this Court from the trial court’s orders. \\n\\n\\x0c-11- \\n\\nII. Legal Analysis \\n\\nA. Standard of Review \\n\\nAn  award  of  summary  judgment  is  appropriate  “if  the \\n\\npleadings,  depositions,  answers  to  interrogatories,  and \\n\\nadmissions  on  file,  together  with  the  affidavits,  if  any,  show \\n\\nthat  there  is  no  genuine  issue  of  material  fact  and  that  any \\n\\nparty  is  entitled  to  judgment  as  a  matter  of  law.”    N.C.  Gen. \\n\\nStat.  §  1A-1,  Rule  56(c).    “A  party  moving  for  summary  judgment \\n\\nmay  prevail  if  it  meets  the  burden  (1)  of  proving  an  essential \\n\\nelement  of  the  opposing  party’s  claim  is  nonexistent,  or  (2)  of \\n\\nshowing through discovery that the opposing party cannot produce \\n\\nevidence  to  support  an  essential  element  of  his  or  her  claim.”  \\n\\nLowe  v.  Bradford,  305  N.C.  366,  369,  289  S.E.2d  363,  366  (1982) \\n\\n(citations  omitted).    “The  party  seeking  summary  judgment  bears \\n\\nthe  initial  burden  of  demonstrating  the  absence  of  a  genuine \\n\\nissue  of  material  fact.”    Liberty  Mut.

However,  “[o]nce  the  party  seeking  summary  judgment \\n\\nmakes  the  required  showing,  the  burden  shifts  to  the  nonmoving \\n\\nparty  to  produce  a  forecast  of  evidence  demonstrating  specific \\n\\nfacts,  as  opposed  to  allegations,  showing  that  he  can  at  least \\n\\nestablish  a  prima  facie  case  at  trial.”    Gaunt  v.

Breach of Fiduciary Duty \\n\\nIn  its  first  challenge  to  the  trial  court’s  order, \\n\\nPlaintiff  contends  that  the  trial  court  erred  by  granting \\n\\nsummary  judgment  in  favor  of  Mr.  Lanier  with  respect  to \\n\\nPlaintiff’s  breach  of  fiduciary  duty  claim.    In  support  of  this \\n\\nargument,  Plaintiff  asserts  that  the  record  discloses  the \\n\\nexistence  of  genuine  issues  of  material  fact  regarding  the \\n\\nextent  to  which  Mr.  Lanier  owed  a  fiduciary  duty  to  Plaintiff \\n\\nand  whether  he  breached  that  duty.    Plaintiff’s  argument  lacks \\n\\nmerit.2 \\n\\n                     \\n\\n2Although  Plaintiff  makes  much  of  allegedly  unsupported \\n“findings”  of  undisputed  fact  in  the  trial  court’s  order,  we \\nneed  not  address  its  specific  complaints  about  these  “findings” \\n\\n\\x0c-14- \\n\\n“For  a  breach  of  fiduciary  duty  to  exist,  there  must  first \\n\\nbe  a  fiduciary  relationship  between  the  parties.

In \\nless  clearly  defined  situations  the  question \\nwhether  a  fiduciary  relationship  exists  is \\nmore  open  and  depends  ultimately  on  the \\ncircumstances.    Courts  have  historically \\ndeclined  to  offer  a  rigid  definition  of  a \\nfiduciary  relationship  in  order  to  allow \\nimposition \\nwhere \\njustified.    Thus,  the  relationship  can  arise \\nin  a  variety  of  circumstances  .  .  .  and  may \\nstem from varied and unpredictable factors. \\n \\n\\nfiduciary \\n\\nduties \\n\\nof \\n\\nHajmm  Co.  v.  House  of  Raeford  Farms,  328  N.C.  578,  588,  403 \\n\\nS.E.2d  483,  489  (1991)  (citing  Casey  v.  Grantham,  239  N.C.  121, \\n\\n124-25, 79 S.E.2d 735, 738 (1954) (other citation omitted). \\n\\nThe  undisputed  evidence  tends  to  show  that  Mr.  Lanier  was \\n\\nthe  foreman  of  a  crew  that  consisted  of  four  men,  including \\n\\nhimself; that his job duties were confined to performing various \\n\\ntasks  related  to  the  provision  of  construction-related \\n\\nmaintenance  services;  and  that  his  employment  was  terminable  at \\n\\nwill  by  Plaintiff.    Under  that  set  of  circumstances,  we  have  no \\n\\ndifficulty in concluding that Mr. Lanier did not occupy the type \\n\\nof  fiduciary  relationship  with  Plaintiff  that  arises  by \\n\\noperation  of  law,  such  as  that  inherent  in  an  attorney-client \\n\\nrelationship.    As  a  result,  the  only  way  in  which  a  fiduciary \\n\\nrelationship between Plaintiff and Mr. Lanier could have existed \\n\\nwould  be  if  Plaintiff  reposed  trust  and  confidence  in  Mr. \\n\\nLanier,  resulting  in  a  situation  in  which  Mr.  Lanier  exercised \\n\\n“superiority and influence” over Plaintiff. \\n\\n\\x0c-16- \\n\\nAlthough  our  appellate  jurisprudence  does  not  precisely \\n\\ndefine when a fiduciary relationship of this second type does or \\n\\ndoes  not  exist,  “the  broad  parameters  accorded  the  term  have \\n\\nbeen  specifically  limited  in  the  context  of  employment \\n\\nsituations.    Under  the  general  rule,  ‘the  relation  of  employer \\n\\nand  employee  is  not  one  of  those  regarded  as  confidential.’”  \\n\\nDalton,  353  N.C.  at  651,  548  S.E.2d  at  708  (quoting  King  v. \\n\\nR.R.,  157  N.C.  44,  62-63,  72  S.E.  801,  808  (1911)  (other \\n\\ncitation  omitted).    As  a  result,  in  the  absence  of  some  unusual \\n\\nset  of  facts  that  would  suffice  to  differentiate  the \\n\\nrelationship  between  Plaintiff  and  Mr.  Lanier  from  other \\n\\nemployer-employee  relationships,  Mr.  Lanier  did  not  have  a \\n\\nfiduciary relationship with Plaintiff. \\n\\nAccording  to  the  record,  Plaintiff’s  corporate  parent  has \\n\\nover  7,000  employees  and  an  annual  income  of  approximately \\n\\n$300,000,000.00  to $500,000,000.00, of which Plaintiff’s  work at \\n\\nTimken’s  Asheboro  plant  generated  approximately  $2,000,000.00, \\n\\nor  .04  percent  to  .06  percent.    Of  these  7,000  or  so  employees, \\n\\nonly  five  were  working  at  the  Asheboro  plant,  which  Plaintiff \\n\\ncharacterizes  as  a  “remote”  company  site.    As  we  have  already \\n\\nnoted,  Mr.  Lanier  was  an  hourly,  at-will  employee  charged  with \\n\\nsupervising a four-person crew.  The record contains no evidence \\n\\ntending  to  show  that  Mr.  Lanier  played  any  role  within \\n\\n\\x0c-17- \\n\\nPlaintiff’s organization except for that of a foreman overseeing \\n\\na crew performing construction-related maintenance services.   In \\n\\nlight of that set of facts, we conclude that any confidence that \\n\\nPlaintiff  reposed  in  Mr.  Lanier  consisted  of  nothing  more  than \\n\\nrelying  on  him  to  competently  perform  his  assigned  duties.  \\n\\nSimply  put,  given  that  the  record  demonstrates  that  Mr.  Lanier \\n\\nwas a relatively small cog in a very large operation, we have no \\n\\nhesitation  about  concluding  that  Mr.  Lanier  exercised  little  or \\n\\nno  control  over  Plaintiff’s  overall  operations  and  that  Mr. \\n\\nLanier did not owe any fiduciary duties to Plaintiff. \\n\\nIn  attempting  to  persuade  us  to  reach  a  contrary \\n\\nconclusion,  Plaintiff  stresses  the  degree  of  responsibility  and \\n\\nauthority  assigned  to  a  foreman  such  as  Mr.  Lanier  and  argues \\n\\nthat he had considerable responsibility for, and authority over, \\n\\nthe  other  crew  members.    However,  the  fact  that  Mr.  Lanier  had \\n\\nresponsibility  for \\n\\nensuring  the  proper  performance  of \\n\\nconstruction-related  maintenance  tasks  assigned  to  his  crew  by \\n\\nMr.  Flickinger  simply  does  not  make  him  Plaintiff’s  fiduciary.  \\n\\nAs the Supreme Court observed in Dalton: \\n\\n.  .  .  [T]he  managerial  duties  of  Camp  were \\nsuch  that  a  certain  level  of  confidence  was \\nreposed  in  him  by  Dalton;  and  (2)  as  a \\nconfidant  of  his  employer,  Camp  was \\ntherefore  bound  to  act  in  good  faith  and \\nwith  due  regard  to  the  interests  of  Dalton.  \\nIn  our  view,  such  circumstances,  as  shown \\nhere,  merely  serve  to  define  the  nature  of \\n\\n\\x0c-18- \\n\\nall \\n\\nvirtually \\nemployer-employee \\nrelationships;  without  more,  they  are \\ninadequate  to  establish  Camp’s  obligations \\nas  fiduciary  in  nature.    No  evidence \\nsuggests  that  his  position  in  the  workplace \\nresulted  in  “domination  and  influence  on  the \\nother  [Dalton],”  an  essential  component  of \\nany  fiduciary  relationship.    Camp  was  hired \\nas  an  at-will  employee  to  manage  the \\nproduction  of  a  publication.  .  .  .    [H]is \\nresponsibilities  were  not  unlike  those  of \\nemployees  in  other  businesses  and  can  hardly \\nbe  construed  as  uniquely  positioning  him  to \\nexercise dominion over Dalton. \\n \\n\\nDalton at 651-52, 548 S.E.2d at 708 (quoting Abbitt, 201 N.C. at \\n\\n598,  160  S.E.  at  906).    Thus,  for  essentially  the  same  reasons \\n\\nthat  underlie  the  Supreme  Court’s  decision  in  Dalton,  we \\n\\nconclude  that  Mr.  Lanier’s  status  as  the  foreman  of  a  four-\\n\\nperson crew did not “uniquely position” him to exercise dominion \\n\\nover Plaintiff. \\n\\nWe  have  carefully  considered  Plaintiff’s  remaining \\n\\narguments  in  support  of  its  claim  that  Mr.  Lanier  breached  his \\n\\nfiduciary  duty  owed  to  Plaintiff,  and  conclude  that  they  lack \\n\\nmerit  as  well.    For  example,  Plaintiff  contends  that  there  are \\n\\ndisputed  issues  of  fact  regarding  the  scope  of  Mr.  Lanier’s \\n\\nresponsibilities  and  authority  given  Plaintiff’s  contention  that \\n\\nMr.  Lanier  “participated  in  any  discussions  [with]  plaintiff’s \\n\\nofficers  concerning  management  level  decisions  or  operations  of \\n\\nthe  company  concerning  cash  flow,  lines  of  credit,  issuance  of \\n\\nstock  or  debt  and  the  like.”    However,  the  only  evidentiary \\n\\n\\x0c-19- \\n\\nsupport that Plaintiff has offered for this argument is the fact \\n\\nthat Mr. Lanier had supervisory responsibility for a four-person \\n\\ncrew  and  that  he  reported  to  Mr.  Richardson,  one  of  Plaintiff’s \\n\\nmanagers.    The  undisputed  record  evidence  shows  that  Mr.  Lanier \\n\\nonly interacted  with Mr. Richardson  concerning matters affecting \\n\\nhis  four-person  crew;  nothing  in  the  record  suggests  that  Mr. \\n\\nLanier  was  ever  involved  in  making  any  “management  level \\n\\ndecisions”  as  that  term  is  ordinarily  understood.    Similarly, \\n\\nPlaintiff  asserts  that  issues  of  fact  regarding  the  extent  to \\n\\nwhich  Mr.  Lanier  owed  a  fiduciary  duty  to  Plaintiff  arise  from \\n\\nlanguage  in  the  MSA  spelling  out  Plaintiff’s  obligation  to \\n\\nemploy  on-site  supervisory  personnel.    However,  the  relevant \\n\\nlanguage from the MSA, which has no binding effect unless Timken \\n\\nactually  contracted  with  Plaintiff  to  perform  specific  work  at \\n\\nthe  Asheboro  plant,  provides  no  additional  basis  for  concluding \\n\\nthat  Mr.  Lanier  had  a  fiduciary  relationship  with  Plaintiff.  \\n\\nMoreover,  Plaintiff  argues  that  the  fact  that  Mr.  Lanier  was  an \\n\\nhourly  at-will  employee  and  had  not  been  asked  to  sign  a  non-\\n\\ncompetition  agreement  or  similar  documents  is  “immaterial  to \\n\\nwhether [Plaintiff] reposed trust and confidence in  [Mr.] Lanier \\n\\nresulting  in  [his]  domination  and  influence  on  [Plaintiff]  at \\n\\nthe  Timken  Asheboro  plant  site.”    In  view  of  the  fact  that  the \\n\\npresence  or  absence  of  such  agreements  did  shed  light  on  the \\n\\n\\x0c-20- \\n\\nnature  of  the  relationship  between  Plaintiff  and  Mr.  Lanier,  we \\n\\nbelieve  that  the  trial  court  properly  considered  these  factors \\n\\nin determining whether to grant summary judgment in favor of Mr. \\n\\nLanier.    As  a  result,  none  of  Plaintiff’s  attempts  to  persuade \\n\\nus  that  there  were  genuine  issues  of  material  fact  concerning \\n\\nthe extent, if any, to which Mr. Lanier owed a fiduciary duty to \\n\\nPlaintiff have any merit. \\n\\nSimilarly,  we  are  unable  to  agree  with  Plaintiff’s \\n\\ncontention  that  the  Supreme  Court’s  decision  in  Sara  Lee  Corp. \\n\\nv.  Carter,  351  N.C.  27,  519  S.E.2d  308,  rehearing  denied,  351 \\n\\nN.C.  191,  541  S.E.2d  716  (1999),  supports  its  contention  that \\n\\nMr. Lanier breached a fiduciary duty that he owed Plaintiff.  In \\n\\nSara  Lee,  the  defendant’s  job  description  required  him  to \\n\\nprovide  the  plaintiff  “‘with  the  best  possible  pricing, \\n\\navailability,  and  support  of  hardware  and  services.’”    In \\n\\nviolation  of  this  obligation,  the  defendant  started  his  own \\n\\ncompany  and  “engaged  in  self-dealing  by  supplying  Sara  Lee  with \\n\\ncomputer  parts  and  services  at  allegedly  excessive  cost  while \\n\\nconcealing  his  interest  in  these  businesses.”    Sara  Lee,  351 \\n\\nN.C.  at  29,  519  S.E.2d  at  309.    On  these  facts,  we  upheld  the \\n\\ntrial  court’s  conclusion  “that  defendant  owed  a  fiduciary  duty \\n\\nto  Sara  Lee  with  respect  to  his  role  in  recommending  the \\n\\npurchase and ordering of computer parts and related services for \\n\\n\\x0c-21- \\n\\nSara  Lee  and  that  defendant  breached  that  fiduciary  duty[.]”  \\n\\nSara  Lee  at  30,  519  S.E.2d  at  310.    However,  the  alleged  breach \\n\\nof  fiduciary  duty  at  issue  in  Sara  Lee  is  very  different  from \\n\\nthe  alleged  breach  of  fiduciary  duty  at  issue  here.    According \\n\\nto Plaintiff: \\n\\nThe  record  evidence  establishing  that \\nthe  self-dealing  [Mr.] \\nLanier  was  a \\nfiduciary  of  [Plaintiff]  is  even  stronger \\nthan  that  of  the  employee  in  Sara  Lee.  \\n[Plaintiff]  entrusted  and  authorized  its \\nSite  Manager  [Mr.]  Lanier  to  interact  with \\nits  valued  customer  Timken  and  to  manage  and \\nsupervise  the  other  [Plaintiff]  employees  at \\nthe  site.    [Mr.]  Lanier  maintained  and \\nrepaired  unique  machinery  for  [Plaintiff’s] \\ncustomer  Timken.    For  [Plaintiff’s]  benefit \\nhe  was  supposed  to  maintain  a  strong \\nrelationship  with  [Mr.]  Flickinger  and \\nprovide  other  support  as  needed.  . . .  \\nInstead,  [Mr.]  Lanier  acted  to  benefit \\nhimself  to  the  strong  detriment  of  his \\nemployer, [Plaintiff]. \\n \\n\\nHowever,  the  record  contains  no  evidence  that  Mr.  Lanier  failed \\n\\nto  “manage  and  supervise  the  other  [Plaintiff]  employees  at  the \\n\\nsite,”  to  “maintain  a  strong  relationship  with  [Mr.] \\n\\nFlickinger,”  to  perform  any  other  duty  arising  from  his  job \\n\\ndescription,  or  to  refrain  from  engaging  in  self-dealing.    On \\n\\nthe  contrary,  the  sole  basis  for  Plaintiff’s  claim  that  Mr. \\n\\nLanier  engaged  in  “self-dealing”  and  acted  “to  benefit  himself \\n\\nto  the  strong  detriment  of  his  employer”  is  the  fact  that  Mr. \\n\\nLanier  resigned  from  his  employment  with  Plaintiff  in  order  to \\n\\n\\x0c-22- \\n\\nwork  for  Crowder  because  he  “was  clearly  not  happy  working  for \\n\\n[Plaintiff]”  and  saw  a  “switch  to  Crowder  as  being  in  his  long-\\n\\nterm  best  interests  from  a  job  satisfaction  perspective.”  \\n\\n(PB29)  However, the fact that an at-will employee stops working \\n\\nfor one employer, as the result of personal dissatisfaction with \\n\\nhis  existing  position,  and  goes  to  work  for  another,  who  then \\n\\ntakes  over  work  that  had  previously  been  performed  by  the \\n\\nemployee’s  original  employer,  is  not  consistent  with  any \\n\\nrecognized  definition  of  “self-dealing,”  see  Black’s  Law \\n\\nDictionary  1390  (8th  ed.  2004)  (defining  self-dealing  as \\n\\n“[p]articipation  in  a  transaction  that  benefits  oneself  instead \\n\\nof another who is owed a fiduciary duty”), and does not bear any \\n\\nsignificant resemblance to the facts at issue in Sara Lee. \\n\\nIn  addition,  Plaintiff  points  out  that  the  Supreme  Court \\n\\nstated  in  Dalton  that  the  defendant,  although  not  a  fiduciary, \\n\\nwas  “bound  to  act  in  good  faith  and  with  due  regard  to  the \\n\\ninterests of” his employer.  Similarly, Plaintiff argues that it \\n\\n“placed  its  trust  and  confidence  in  [Mr.]  Lanier  and  that  [he] \\n\\nused  that  trust,  confidence  and  resulting  power  to  dominate \\n\\n[Plaintiff] \\n\\nand \\n\\n[Plaintiff’s] \\n\\nother \\n\\nemployees \\n\\nand, \\n\\nsurreptitiously,  from  the  inside,  stole  away  the  very  business \\n\\nhe  was  supposed  to  service  and  safeguard  for  [Plaintiff].”  \\n\\nHowever,  the  record  contains  no  evidence  tending  to  show  that \\n\\n\\x0c-23- \\n\\nMr.  Lanier  had  any  responsibility,  beyond  the  adequate \\n\\nperformance  of  his  job  duties,  for  safeguarding  Timken’s \\n\\ndecision  to  contract  with  Plaintiff,  instead  of  some  other \\n\\nentity,  for  the  provision  of  construction-related  maintenance \\n\\nservices  at  the  Asheboro  plant.    As  a  result,  we  do  not  believe \\n\\nthat Plaintiff’s argument in reliance upon Dalton has any merit. \\n\\nWe  have  carefully  examined  Plaintiff’s  factual  contentions \\n\\nregarding  the  circumstances  surrounding  the  resignation  of  Mr. \\n\\nLanier  and  his  co-workers  from  their  employment  with  Plaintiff \\n\\nand  Timken’s  decision  to  transfer  construction  maintenance \\n\\nservice  work  from  Plaintiff  to  Crowder  and  have  concluded  that \\n\\nthese  contentions  lack  adequate  record  support.    For  example, \\n\\nPlaintiff  contends  that  Mr.  Lanier  “leveraged  the  trust  and \\n\\nconfidence  reposed  in  him  by  [Plaintiff]  to  pressure  both \\n\\n[Plaintiff’s]  other  employees  and  [Mr.]  Flickinger  into \\n\\nsubmitting  to  a  conspiracy  with  Crowder  to  replace  [Plaintiff] \\n\\nwith  Crowder  at  the  Timken  Asheboro  plant  site.”    In  addition, \\n\\nPlaintiff repeatedly asserts that Mr. Lanier “pressured” his co-\\n\\nworkers  and  Mr.  Flickinger  to  work  with  Crowder  instead  of \\n\\nPlaintiff  and  contends  that,  in  order  to  “achieve  his  self-\\n\\ndealing  goal,  [Mr.]  Lanier  directed  the  crew  to  . . .  resign  en \\n\\nmasse  from  [Plaintiff]  in  the  middle  of  a  critical  machine \\n\\nmove.”    Finally,  Plaintiff  contends  that  Mr.  Lanier  “filtered \\n\\n\\x0cand  provided  the  information  that  he  thought  would  best  advance \\n\\nhis  self-dealing  conspiracy  with  Crowder  to  steal  the  Timken \\n\\n-24- \\n\\nbusiness.” \\n\\nAfter  thoroughly  reviewing  the  evidentiary  materials  that \\n\\nwere  submitted  for  the  trial  court’s  consideration,  we  find  no \\n\\nevidence  that  Mr.  Lanier  “pressured”  his  crew  to  resign  their \\n\\nemployment  with  Plaintiff  or  to  begin  working  for  Crowder  or \\n\\nthat  Plaintiff  “filtered”  the  information  that  they  received \\n\\nprior  to  deciding  to  change  employers.    As  we  have  already \\n\\nnoted,  each  crew  member  testified  that,  even  before  learning  of \\n\\na  possible  position  at  Crowder,  they  were  planning  to  leave \\n\\nPlaintiff’s employment.  None of the crew members testified that \\n\\nMr. Lanier “pressured” them into resigning their employment with \\n\\nPlaintiff;  in  fact,  the  record  is  completely  devoid  of  any \\n\\nevidence  that  Mr.  Lanier  suggested  that  the  members  of  the  crew \\n\\nshould work for Crowder rather than Plaintiff.  Similarly, there \\n\\nis  no  evidence  that  Mr.  Lanier  concealed  or  “filtered” \\n\\ninformation  in  order  to  “pressure”  his  crew  into  leaving \\n\\nPlaintiff’s  employment.    Although  the  record  does  reflect  that \\n\\nTracy  Moore  sent  copies  of  Crowder’s  benefits  package  to  Mr. \\n\\nLanier  for  delivery  to  the  members  of  the  crew  and  subsequently \\n\\nmet  with  the  crew  to  answer  any  questions  they  might  have, \\n\\nnothing  in  the  record  reflects  that  Mr.  Lanier  did  anything  to \\n\\n\\x0c-25- \\n\\nput  pressure  on  his  fellow  crew  members  to  leave  their \\n\\nemployment with Plaintiff and to begin working with Crowder. \\n\\nSimilarly,  we  find  no  indication  that  Mr.  Lanier \\n\\n“pressured”  Mr.  Flickinger  into  using  Crowder  rather  than \\n\\nPlaintiff  for  the  purpose  of  providing  construction-related \\n\\nmaintenance  services  at  the  Asheboro  plant.    Mr.  Flickinger \\n\\ntestified that he had worked with Mr. Lanier for over ten years, \\n\\nthat  “[Mr.  Lanier’s]  work  is  always  top-notch,”  and  that, \\n\\n“[p]ersonally[,]  I  think  he’s  []  very  honest[.]”    During  the \\n\\nfour  months  that  Mr.  Lanier  worked  for  Plaintiff  at  Timken’s \\n\\nAsheboro  plant,  he  and  his  crew  did  a  good  job  and  were  “very \\n\\nconscientious”  about  safety  regulations.    After  the  crew  began \\n\\nto  have  problems  with  Plaintiff,  Mr.  Flickinger  consulted  with \\n\\nTimken’s \\n\\nmanagement \\n\\nabout \\n\\nchanging \\n\\nconstruction-related \\n\\nmaintenance  providers  and  learned  that  he  had  no  contractual \\n\\nobligation  to  continue  using  Plaintiff’s  services.    When  Mr. \\n\\nLanier  spoke  with  Mr.  Flickinger  about  the  possibility  that \\n\\nCrowder  would  assume  responsibility  for  performing  construction-\\n\\nrelated  maintenance  work  at  the  Asheboro  plant,  Mr.  Flickinger \\n\\nindicated that he was open to a proposal from Crowder.  In fact, \\n\\nMr.  Flickinger  testified  that  he  intended  to  continue  working \\n\\nwith  Mr.  Lanier’s  crew  regardless  of  whether  they  were  employed \\n\\nby  Plaintiff,  Crowder,  or  some  other  company.    Simply  put, \\n\\n\\x0c-26- \\n\\nnothing  in  the  present  record  in  any  way  tends  to  show  that  Mr. \\n\\nFlickinger’s  preference  for  working  with  Mr.  Lanier’s  crew  had \\n\\nany source other than his satisfaction with the quality of their \\n\\nwork. \\n\\nIn  addition,  although  Plaintiff  argues  that  the  crew  timed \\n\\nits  resignation  from  Plaintiff’s  employment  in  such  a  way  as  to \\n\\nforce  Mr.  Flickinger’s  hand  “by  scheduling  the  .  .  .  crew’s  en \\n\\nmasse  resignation  in  the  middle  of  a  planned  critical  machine \\n\\nmove,”  the  record  simply  does  not  support  this  assertion.  \\n\\nInstead,  the  undisputed  evidence  in  the  record  indicates  that \\n\\nMr.  Lanier’s  crew  worked  several  hours  overtime  on  14  October \\n\\n2010 for the sole purpose of preventing any production delays in \\n\\nthe  event  that  the  crew  was  unable  to  return  to  the  Asheboro \\n\\nplant  on  the  following  Monday  as  employees  of  Crowder.    In \\n\\nessence,  Mr.  Flickinger  testified  that,  when  Mr.  Lanier  left  on \\n\\n14  October  2010,  the  work  being  done  on  the  machine  had  reached \\n\\n“a  point  it  would  be  operational  so  if  no  one  was  there  Monday \\n\\n. . . we could continue operations;” that the crew “finished the \\n\\nwork  that  the  mechanical  contractor  would  have  needed  to  that \\n\\nday,  so  if  no  one  showed  up  Monday,  we  could  have  continued  to \\n\\nwork  with  our  associates  and  made  product;”  and  that,  when  the \\n\\nmembers  of  the  crew  resigned  from  Plaintiff’s  employment,  their \\n\\npart in the machine move was essentially “complete.”   Similarly, \\n\\n\\x0c-27- \\n\\nMr.  Lanier  testified  that  the  crew  worked  on  14  October  2010  in \\n\\norder  to  “get  that  machine  back  where  somebody  could  finish  it \\n\\nif  something  happened.”    As  a  result,  we  conclude  that  there  is \\n\\nno record support for Plaintiff’s contention that Mr. Flickinger \\n\\nwas  forced  to  stop  using  Plaintiff  for  the  provision  of \\n\\nconstruction  maintenance  services  based  upon  pressure  from  Mr. \\n\\nLanier,  the  timing  of  the  crew’s  resignation,  or  any  other \\n\\nsimilar factor.3 \\n\\nPlaintiff also asserts that Mr. Lanier acted “secretly” and \\n\\nthat  he  “secretly  recruited  the  entire  work  force  and  betrayed \\n\\n[Plaintiff]  in  persuading  [Mr.]  Flickinger  to  switch  to  the \\n\\ncompany  that  best  suited  him,  to  the  detriment  of  [Plaintiff].”  \\n\\nA  careful  examination  of  the  record  reveals  no  indication  that \\n\\nMr.  Lanier  or  his  crew  made  any  effort  to  hide  their \\n\\ndissatisfaction with Plaintiff.  Mr. Lanier discussed the crew’s \\n\\ncomplaints  with  Mr.  Flickinger,  who  testified  that,  every  time \\n\\nMr. Richardson visited the plant, “[he] would tell him, the guys \\n\\naren’t  happy,  you  need  to  try  to  help[.]”    In  addition,  the \\n\\nrecord  reflects  that  Mr.  Rice  met  with  Mr.  Lanier  in  mid-August \\n\\n2010  and,  at  Mr.  Lanier’s  request,  informed  Plaintiff  of  the \\n\\ncrew’s  dissatisfaction.    On  23  August  2010,  Mr.  Rice  sent  Mr. \\n\\nRichardson  an  email  that  specifically  informed  him  that  Mr. \\n                     \\n\\n3Mr.  Richardson  testified  that  he  had  no  personal  knowledge \\n\\nof the status of the machine move as of 14 October 2010. \\n\\n\\x0c-28- \\n\\nLanier  was  “looking  at  other  contactors  to  work  for  in  the \\n\\nTimken Asheboro plant, and right now the only thing stalling the \\n\\nchange  is  which  company  will  offer  the  best  pay  and  benefits.”  \\n\\nThe  fact  that  Mr.  Richardson  claims  not  to  have  noticed  this \\n\\nportion  of  the  email  does  not  in  any  way  detract  from  the  fact \\n\\nthat  it  was  sent.    As  a  result,  the  record  contains  no \\n\\nindication that Mr. Lanier acted secretly. \\n\\nIn  addition,  such  an  allegation,  even  if  proven,  would  not \\n\\nnecessarily  constitute  evidence  of  wrongdoing.    Plaintiff  has \\n\\nnot  cited  any  authority  tending  to  suggest  that  Mr.  Lanier  had \\n\\nan  obligation  to  keep  Plaintiff  apprised  of  his  desire  to  quit, \\n\\nhis  discussions  with  co-workers  about  changing  jobs,  or  his \\n\\nnegotiations  with  Crowder.    “In  North  Carolina,  ‘in  the  absence \\n\\nof  an  employment  contract  for  a  definite  period,  both  employer \\n\\nand  employee  are  generally  free  to  terminate  their  association \\n\\nat  any  time  and  without  any  reason.’”    Elliott  v.

As  a  result,  for  all  of  these  reasons,  we \\n\\nconclude  that  the  trial  court  did  not  err  by  granting  summary \\n\\njudgment  in  favor  of  Mr.  Lanier  with  respect  to  Plaintiff’s \\n\\nbreach of fiduciary duty claim. \\n\\nC. Tortious Interference with Contract \\n\\nSecondly,  Plaintiff  argues  that  the  trial  court  erred  by \\n\\ngranting summary judgment in favor of Defendants with respect to \\n\\nPlaintiff’s  tortious  interference  with  contract  claim.    In \\n\\nsupport  of  this  contention,  Plaintiff  contends  that  the  record \\n\\nreflects the existence of a genuine issue of fact concerning the \\n\\nextent  to  which  “Defendants  conspired  to  pressure  [Mr.] \\n\\nFlickinger  not  to  perform  the  MSA  with  Austin  and  to  hire \\n\\nCrowder  instead”  and  to  which  “Defendants  acted  without \\n\\njustification.”    Once  again,  we  conclude  that  Plaintiff’s \\n\\narguments lack merit. \\n\\n“The  tort  of  interference  with  contract  has  five  elements:  \\n\\n(1)  a  valid  contract  between  the  plaintiff  and  a  third  person \\n\\nwhich  confers  upon  the  plaintiff  a  contractual  right  against  a \\n\\nthird  person;  (2)  the  defendant  knows  of  the  contract;  (3)  the \\n\\n\\x0c-30- \\n\\ndefendant  intentionally  induces  the  third  person  not  to  perform \\n\\nthe  contract;  (4)  and  in  doing  so  acts  without  justification; \\n\\n(5)  resulting  in  actual  damage  to  the  plaintiff.”    United \\n\\nLaboratories,  Inc.  v.  Kuykendall,  322  N.C.  643,  661,  370  S.E.2d \\n\\n375,  387  (1988)  (citing  Childress  v.  Abeles,  240  N.C.  667,  674 \\n\\n84  S.E.  2d  176,  182-83  (1954)).    A  careful  study  of  the  record \\n\\ncompels  the  conclusion  that  Plaintiff  has  failed  to  forecast \\n\\nevidence  tending  to  show  the  existence  of  the  first  element \\n\\nrequired  to  establish  a  tortious  interference  with  contract \\n\\nclaim. \\n\\nAs  we  have  already  noted,  the  MSA  sets  out  the  terms  and \\n\\nconditions  under  which  Plaintiff  and  Timken  agreed  to  do \\n\\nbusiness.    “It  is  common  practice  for  companies  and  contractors \\n\\nto  enter  into  master  service  agreements,  the  specific  terms  of \\n\\nwhich govern future work performed by the contractor pursuant to \\n\\nindividual  work  orders  or  authorizations.”    John  E.  Graham  & \\n\\nSons v. Brewer (In re John E. Graham & Sons), 210 F.3d 333, 341, \\n\\nrehearing  denied,  2000  U.S.  App.  LEXIS  15071  (5th  Cir.  La.

Ed. 2d 302 (2010).  “A master service agreement \\n\\ncontemplates  as  yet  unspecified  and  wholly  contingent \\n\\nperformance  in  the  future.    The  agreement  standing  alone \\n\\nobligates  neither  party  to  perform  any  services.    The  issuance \\n\\nof  a  specific  work  order  triggers  the  obligation  to  perform.”  \\n\\nBurnham  v.  Sun  Oil  Co.,  618  F.  Supp.  782,  785-86  (W.D.  La. \\n\\n1985). \\n\\nConsistently  with  the  pattern  outlined  above,  the  MSA \\n\\ndefines Timken as the “Buyer” and Plaintiff (standing in Sanders \\n\\nBrothers’  shoes)  as  the  “Contractor,”  provides  for  a  seven  year \\n\\nterm,  and  defines  a  “Purchase  Order”  as  the  “document  or \\n\\nelectronic  notification  through  which  Service(s)  and/or \\n\\nMerchandise  shall  be  requested  by  Buyer.”    The  MSA  “shall  be \\n\\nincorporated into and made a part of each Buyer’s Purchase Order \\n\\nissued  to  Contractor,  whether  or  not  expressly  incorporated  by \\n\\nreference  in  the  Purchase  Order,”  and,  “together  with  . . . \\n\\nPurchase  Order(s)  . . .  and  other  documents  specifically \\n\\nincorporated  by  reference  . . . [,]  comprise  the  entire \\n\\nagreement  between  the  parties.”    The  MSA  does  not  include  an \\n\\nagreement  by  Timken  or  Plaintiff  to  enter  into  any  particular \\n\\nnumber  of  contracts  for  the  provision  of  construction-related \\n\\nmaintenance  services;  instead,  the  MSA  expressly  states  that \\n\\n\\x0c-32- \\n\\n“Contractor acknowledges that this Agreement is not a commitment \\n\\nby  Buyer  to  purchase  any  Service(s)  and/or  Merchandise  from \\n\\nContractor on an exclusive basis or otherwise.”  As a result, we \\n\\nconclude that the MSA does not obligate Timken to enter into any \\n\\nPurchase  Orders  with  Plaintiff,  a  fact  which  requires  a  finding \\n\\nthat  Timken’s  decision  to  award  specific  construction-related \\n\\nmaintenance service contracts to Crowder did not breach the MSA. \\n\\nIn  seeking  to  persuade  us  that  the  record  did,  in  fact, \\n\\nreflect  the  existence  of  a  genuine  issue  of  material  fact  with \\n\\nrespect  to  this  issue,  Plaintiff  relies  solely  on  Mr. \\n\\nRichardson’s  testimony  concerning  the  existence  of  “verbal \\n\\nagreements”  that  were  allegedly  entered  into  outside  the  scope \\n\\nof  the  MSA.    The  principal  problem  with  this  argument  is  that \\n\\nthe MSA contains a merger clause which clearly provides that the \\n\\nMSA,  taken  in  conjunction  with  other  pertinent  written \\n\\ndocuments, constitutes the entire  agreement between  the parties.  \\n\\nIn addition, Plaintiff directs our attention to Mr. Richardson’s \\n\\nbelief  that  the  provision  to  the  effect  that  the  MSA  “is  not  a \\n\\ncommitment  by  Buyer  to  purchase  any  Service(s)  and/or \\n\\nMerchandise  from  Contractor  on  an  exclusive  basis  or  otherwise” \\n\\nshould  be  understood  to  mean  that  Timken  was  obligated  to \\n\\ncontract  with  Plaintiff  for  the  provision  of  construction-\\n\\nrelated  maintenance  services  while  retaining  the  ability  to \\n\\n\\x0c-33- \\n\\nemploy \\n\\nspecialty \\n\\ncontractors \\n\\nas \\n\\nnecessary. \\n\\n \\n\\nThis \\n\\n“interpretation”  is,  however,  contrary  to  the  literal  language \\n\\nof the relevant MSA provision, so we decline to adopt it. \\n\\nIn  addition,  Plaintiff  disputes  Defendants’  contention  that \\n\\nthe  MSA  does  not  require  Timken  to  obtain  construction-related \\n\\nmaintenance services exclusively from Plaintiff.  This aspect of \\n\\nPlaintiff’s  argument  rests  upon  Article  36  of  the  MSA,  which \\n\\nstates  that  “[t]he  Contractor  agrees  to  supply  the  listed \\n\\nServices  and/or  Merchandise  to  all  Buyers,  and  Buyer’s \\n\\nsubsidiaries’  facilities,  including  but  not  limited  to”  Timken \\n\\nbearing  and  alloy  steel  plants  located  in  certain  specified \\n\\nstates.  This provision, which simply specifies the geographical \\n\\nscope  of  the  agreement,  does  not  operate  to  override  the \\n\\nremainder  of  the  agreement,  which  clearly  requires  separate \\n\\nPurchase  Orders  in  the  event  that  Timken  wished  Plaintiff  to \\n\\nperform  any  specific  service.    Moreover,  although  Article  36 \\n\\nobligates  Plaintiff  to  supply  construction-related  maintenance \\n\\nservices  to  a  list  of  locations,  it  does  not  obligate  Timken  to \\n\\ncontract  for  these  services  at  any  of  those  locations.    Thus, \\n\\nthis aspect of Plaintiff’s argument fails as well. \\n\\nAs a result, in light of our review of the MSA, we conclude \\n\\nthat  (1)  the  MSA  does  not  require  Timken  to  contract  with \\n\\nPlaintiff  for  provision  of  construction  maintenance  services, \\n\\n\\x0c-34- \\n\\neither  at  its  Asheboro  plant  or  elsewhere;  (2)  the  MSA  does  not \\n\\nconfer  any  specific  contractual  rights  upon  Plaintiff  until \\n\\nTimken  and  Plaintiff  executed  a  Purchase  Order  which  required \\n\\nPlaintiff to provide specific construction maintenance services;4 \\n\\nand  (3),  as  Mr.  Richardson  conceded  during  his  deposition, \\n\\nTimken  did  not  breach  the  MSA  by  beginning  to  use  Crowder, \\n\\nrather  than  Plaintiff,  to  perform  construction  maintenance \\n\\nservices  at  Timken’s  Asheboro  plant.    As  a  result,  given  that \\n\\nthe  MSA  conferred  no  contractual  rights  on  Plaintiff  until  the \\n\\nexecution  of  a  specific  Purchase  Order  and  given  that  Plaintiff \\n\\nfailed  to  adduce  any  evidence  that  Timken  failed  to  perform  any \\n\\nof  its  obligations  under  the  MSA,  we  conclude  that  Plaintiff \\n\\nfailed  to  produce  evidence  that  the  MSA  “confers  upon  the \\n\\nplaintiff  a  contractual  right  against  a  third  person.”    United \\n\\nLaboratories,  322  N.C.  at  661,  370  S.E.2d  at  387.    Thus,  the \\n\\ntrial court did not err by granting summary judgment in favor of \\n\\nDefendants  with  respect  to  Plaintiff’s  tortious  interference \\n\\nwith contract claim. \\n\\nD. Unfair or Deceptive Trade Practices \\n\\nThirdly,  Plaintiff  argues  that  the  trial  court  erred  by \\n\\ngranting summary judgment in favor of Defendants with respect to \\n                     \\n\\n4Plaintiff does not assert that Timken violated any specific \\nPurchase  Order  as  a  result  of  Defendants’  conduct.    Instead, \\nPlaintiff’s tortious interference claim relies solely on alleged \\nviolations of the MSA. \\n\\n\\x0c-35- \\n\\nits  unfair  or  deceptive  trade  practices  claim.    In  support  of \\n\\nthis  contention,  Plaintiff  argues  that  Defendants  “interrupted \\n\\nthe  commercial  relationship  between  Austin  and  Timken,”  that \\n\\n“their actions of hiring away the entire work force and inducing \\n\\nnon-performance  of  the  Austin/Timken  MSA  by  Timken”  constituted \\n\\nunfair  and  deceptive  trade  practices,  and  that  Mr.  Lanier \\n\\n“surreptitiously  raided  the  entire  Austin  workforce  to  his  and \\n\\nCrowder’s  benefit  and  to  the  clear  detriment  of  Austin.”    We  do \\n\\nnot find Plaintiff’s arguments persuasive. \\n\\n“The  extent  of  trade  practices  deemed  as  unfair  and \\n\\ndeceptive  is  summarized  in  [N.C.  Gen.  Stat.]  §  75-1.1(a)  (‘the \\n\\nAct’),  which  . . .  was  intended  to  benefit  consumers[.]  . . .  \\n\\n[T]he Act does not normally extend to run-of-the-mill employment \\n\\ndisputes[,  unless]  . . .  an  employee’s  conduct:    (1)  involved \\n\\negregious  activities  outside  the  scope  of  his  assigned \\n\\nemployment  duties,  and  (2)  otherwise  qualified  as  unfair  or \\n\\ndeceptive  practices  that  were  in  or  affecting  commerce.”  \\n\\nDalton,  353  N.C.  at  655-56,  548  S.E.2d  at  710-11  (citing  Pearce \\n\\nv.

As \\n\\na  result,  we  conclude  that  the  record  fails  to  support \\n\\nPlaintiff’s  assertion  that  Defendants  “surreptitiously  raided” \\n\\nPlaintiff’s  workforce  and  that  neither  the  decision  by  Mr. \\n\\nLanier  and  his  crew  members  to  become  Crowder  employees  nor  the \\n\\nmanner  in  which  Crowder  obtained  the  right  to  perform \\n\\nconstruction-related  maintenance  work  previously  performed  by \\n\\n\\x0cPlaintiff supported a finding of liability under N.C. Gen. Stat. \\n\\n-37- \\n\\n§ 75-1.1. \\n\\nIn  urging  us  to  reach  a  contrary  result,  Plaintiff  cites \\n\\nSunbelt  Rentals,  Inc.  v.  Head  &  Engquist  Equip.,  L.L.C.,  174 \\n\\nN.C. App. 49, 620 S.E.2d 222 (2005), disc. review dismissed, 360 \\n\\nN.C.  296,  629  S.E.2d  289  (2006).    According  to  Plaintiff, \\n\\nSunbelt  “expressly  prohibits  as  an  unfair  trade  practice  the \\n\\nsurreptitious  and  intentional  use  of  employees  to  solicit  other \\n\\nemployees  while  both  the  soliciting  and  solicited  employees  are \\n\\nstill  employed  by  the  same  company.”    Aside  from  the  fact  that \\n\\nwe  do  not  read  Sunbelt  as  enunciating  a  per  se  rule  of  the \\n\\nnature  described  by  Plaintiff  and  the  fact  that  Sunbelt  is \\n\\nreadily  distinguishable  from  this  case  on  a  factual  basis,  the \\n\\nrecord  does  not  contain  any  evidence  tending  to  show  that \\n\\nDefendants  engaged  in  “the  surreptitious  and  intentional  use  of \\n\\nemployees to solicit other employees.” \\n\\nIn  Sunbelt,  the  president  and  other  key  executives  of  a \\n\\ncorporation  resigned  in  order  to  work  for  a  competitor.  \\n\\nSubsequently,  they  secretly  recruited  more  than  seventy  key \\n\\nmanagerial  employees  at  various  locations  to  join  them.    The \\n\\nresult  of  this  series  of  activities  was  that  the  plaintiff’s \\n\\n“branches  were  severely  impacted,  or  ‘crippled,’  to  the  point \\n\\n[that  the  plaintiff’s]  opportunity  and  ability  to  compete  for \\n\\n\\x0c-38- \\n\\nkey  employees  on  a  level  playing  field  was  completely \\n\\neliminated.”    Sunbelt,  174  N.C.  App  at  51,  60,  620  S.E.2d  at \\n\\n225,  230.    In  addition,  the  defendants  misappropriated  trade \\n\\nsecrets  by  sharing  certain  confidential  information  with  this \\n\\ncompetitor.    On  the  other  hand,  in  this  case  a  four-man  work \\n\\ncrew,  all  of  whom  were  at-will  employees  responsible  for \\n\\nperforming  construction-related  maintenance  services,  became \\n\\ndissatisfied  with  Plaintiff  and  left  to  work  for  a  different \\n\\ncompany.  Aside from the fact that the resignation of these four \\n\\nmen  from  an  organization  employing  over  7,000  employees  differs \\n\\ndramatically  from  the  situation  at  issue  in  Sunbelt,  the  record \\n\\ndoes  not  establish  that  the  events  in  question  involved  the \\n\\ndisclosure  of  confidential  information,  had  significant  impact \\n\\non  Plaintiff’s  financial  situation,  or  caused  damage  to \\n\\nPlaintiff’s  competitive  position.    Thus,  we  do  not  believe  that \\n\\nSunbelt  has  any  significant  bearing  on  the  proper  resolution  of \\n\\nthis case. \\n\\nIn addition, Plaintiff cites Songwooyarn Trading Co. v. Sox \\n\\nEleven, __ N.C. App __, 714 S.E.2d 162, disc. review denied, 365 \\n\\nN.C.  360,  718  S.E.2d  396  (2011),  in  support  of  its  attempt  to \\n\\nestablish  the  validity  of  its  unfair  or  deceptive  trade \\n\\npractices  claim.    In  Songwooyarn,  the  defendant  misappropriated \\n\\nfunds  belonging  to  his  employer  and  secretly  diverted  monies \\n\\n\\x0c-39- \\n\\nthat were supposed to be paid to one of his employer’s corporate \\n\\naffiliates  for  his  own  use.    On  appeal,  we  upheld  the  trial \\n\\ncourt’s  decision  to  direct  a  verdict  in  favor  of  the  plaintiff \\n\\nwith  respect  to  its  unfair  and  deceptive  trade  practices  claim.  \\n\\nSongwooyarn  is  easily  distinguished  from  the  facts  of  the \\n\\npresent case and does not control its outcome. \\n\\nAlthough  Plaintiff’s  unfair  and  deceptive  trade  practices \\n\\nclaim  rests  on  allegations  that  Defendants  “secretly  pressured” \\n\\nPlaintiff’s  employees  to  change  jobs,  thereby  “induc[ing]” \\n\\nTimken  to  breach  the  MSA,  the  record  does  not,  as  we  have \\n\\nalready  demonstrated,  support  these  assertions.    As  a  result, \\n\\nnone of the arguments upon which Plaintiff relies in challenging \\n\\nthe  trial  court’s  decision  to  grant  summary  judgment  in \\n\\nDefendants’  favor  with  respect  to  Plaintiff’s  unfair  and \\n\\ndeceptive trade practices claim have merit. \\n\\nE. Civil Conspiracy and Injunctive Relief \\n\\nFinally,  Plaintiff  argues  that  the  trial  court  erred  by \\n\\ngranting summary judgment in favor of Defendants with respect to \\n\\nits  civil  conspiracy  claim  and  its  request  for  injunctive \\n\\nrelief.    Plaintiff  has  not,  however,  advanced  any  specific \\n\\narguments  directed  in  opposition  to  the  trial  court’s  rulings \\n\\nwith respect to these claims.  Instead, Plaintiff simply asserts \\n\\nthat,  “[f]or  the  reasons  discussed”  in  addressing  its  other \\n\\n\\x0c-40- \\n\\nchallenges  to  the  trial  court’s  rulings,  the  trial  court  erred \\n\\nby  granting  summary  judgment  with  respect  to  Plaintiff’s  civil \\n\\nconspiracy  claim  and  by  denying  Plaintiff’s  request  for  the \\n\\nissuance  of  a  permanent  injunction.    Having  already  considered \\n\\nand  rejected  these  arguments,  we  necessarily  conclude  that  the \\n\\ntrial  court  did  not  err  by  granting  summary  judgment  in \\n\\nDefendants’  favor  with  respect  to  Plaintiff’s  civil  conspiracy \\n\\nclaim and rejecting its request for injunctive relief. \\n\\nIII. Conclusion \\n\\nThus, for the reasons set forth above, we conclude that the \\n\\ntrial  court  did  not  err  by  entering  orders  granting  summary \\n\\njudgment  in  favor  of  Defendants  and  denying  Plaintiff’s  request \\n\\nfor  the  issuance  of  a  permanent  injunction.    As  a  result,  the \\n\\ntrial court’s orders should be, and hereby are, affirmed. \\n\\nAFFIRMED. \\n\\nJudges McGEE and STEELMAN concur. \\n\\n\\x0c'"

       "'no. coa12-201 north carolina court of appeals filed: 18 december 2012 austin maintenance & construction, inc., plaintiff v. crowder construction company and steve lanier, defendants mecklenburg county no. 10 cvs 22651 appeal by plaintiff from judgments entered 2 november 2011 by judge calvin e. murphy in mecklenburg county superior court. heard in the court of appeals 14 august 2012. moye, o’brien, o’rourke, pickert & dillon, llp, by j. andrew williams, stephen w. pickert, and peter c. anderson, for plaintiff-appellant. erwin, bishop, capitano & moss, p.a., by joseph w. moss, jr., for defendant-appellee steve lanier. johnston, allison & hord, p.a., by michael l. wilson and kerry crowder construction company. defendant-appellee traynum, for l. ervin, judge. plaintiff austin maintenance & construction, inc., appeals from orders granting summary judgment in favor of defendants steve lanier and crowder construction company with respect to plaintiff’s breach of fiduciary duty claim, which had been -2- asserted solely against mr. lanier; plaintiff’s claims for tortious interference with contract, unfair or deceptive trade practices, and civil conspiracy, which had been asserted against both defendants; and plaintiff’s request for injunctive relief. on appeal, plaintiff argues that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of defendants on the grounds that the record reveals the existence of genuine issues of material fact concerning whether mr. lanier breached a fiduciary duty that he owed plaintiff and whether defendants tortiously interfered with a contract between plaintiff and the timken company, engaged in unfair or deceptive trade practices, and participated in a civil conspiracy, and on the grounds that plaintiff was entitled to injunctive relief. after careful consideration of plaintiff’s challenges to the trial court’s orders in light of the record and the applicable law, we conclude that the trial court’s orders should be affirmed. i. background a. substantive facts timken operates a “tapered roller bearing” manufacturing plant in randleman, a town near asheboro. timken personnel refer to this facility as the asheboro plant. between 2006 and 2010, sanders brothers inc. provided construction-related maintenance services at timken’s asheboro plant and several -3- other timken plants pursuant to a master service agreement (msa). the msa set out the general terms and conditions which would apply to specific contracts into which timken and sanders might enter in the future. the msa did not provide for the provision of specific services or obligate either party to enter into specific contracts; instead, the msa provided that timken would execute purchase orders memorializing any future contracts between the parties. in 2010, sanders experienced serious financial difficulties. at that point, rick flickinger, the manager of timken’s asheboro plant, investigated the possibility of procuring construction-related maintenance services from a different company. in the course of that process, crowder, which competes with plaintiff in the construction maintenance business, made mr. flickinger’s “short list.” however, after sanders brothers assigned its rights under the msa to plaintiff effective on 9 june 2010, plaintiff assumed responsibility for providing construction-related maintenance services at timken’s asheboro plant instead. at the time that plaintiff began providing construction maintenance services at the asheboro plant, mr. lanier had been employed at that facility for twelve years, with the last six years of that period having been spent as a sanders brothers -4- employee. mr. lanier supervised a crew consisting of three other men who had also worked at the plant for at least five years – james moore, willard mcdaniel, and earl turner.1 the crew performed various tasks at the direction of mr. flickinger, including welding, metal fabrication, wiring, repairing the water pipes and coolant system, pipe fitting, and performing other machine repairs. in addition, timken had a “tendency to rearrange machines” in the asheboro plant, so mr. lanier’s crew was involved in implementing these “machine moves” as well. the machines were very large; moving them required a complex series of procedures including the performance of some construction- related work. after plaintiff purchased sanders brothers’ rights under the msa, it hired mr. lanier and the other members of the crew as hourly, at-will employees. mr. lanier continued to serve as crew foreman after coming into plaintiff’s employment; his immediate supervisor was jack richardson, one of plaintiff’s general managers. as crew superintendent and plaintiff’s highest ranking employee at the asheboro plant, plaintiff had additional responsibilities over and above those assigned to the 1mr. lanier’s crew originally included a janitor named juan estrada. however, crowder did not hire mr. estrada because of questions about his immigration status. as a result, all references to mr. lanier’s crew throughout the remainder of this opinion should be understood as encompassing only the four individuals named in the text. -5- other crew members. among other things, mr. lanier supervised the crew, coordinated their work on specific projects, and had the right to select crew members and request pay raises. mr. lanier also had certain record-keeping responsibilities, including documenting compliance with safety regulations, overseeing weekly employee time sheets, and preparing documents that plaintiff used to generate invoices and prepare other reports. finally, mr. lanier functioned as the primary source of communication between his crew and the individuals directly responsible for operating timken’s asheboro plant and plaintiff. mr. lanier did not work from an office; instead, he performed his supervisory tasks while working with the rest of the crew on construction-related maintenance projects. neither mr. lanier nor any other member of the crew was asked to sign a non- competition agreement, a non-solicitation agreement, or a confidentiality agreement. within a month after becoming employed by plaintiff, the members of the crew became dissatisfied with the manner in which plaintiff handled certain administrative issues, the amount of paperwork that plaintiff required, and the manner in which plaintiff responded to their concerns. as a result, all four crew members began looking for other employment during the summer of 2010. -6- on 14 july 2010, james moore called brian gossett, a crowder employee with whom james moore had worked when both were employed by sanders brothers at the asheboro plant. at that time, james moore, who wanted to “get away from [plaintiff],” asked mr. gossett if he might obtain employment at crowder. after mr. gossett indicated that crowder was always looking for good workers, james moore gave him mr. lanier’s phone number. mr. gossett, in turn, agreed to provide mr. lanier’s phone number to tracy moore, who held a management position with crowder. on the following day, tracy moore called mr. lanier. at that time, mr. lanier and tracy moore discussed the possibility that mr. lanier’s entire crew would begin working for crowder. during that conversation, mr. lanier asked tracy moore to send him information concerning the salary and benefit package that crowder would be in a position to offer to members of the crew. mr. lanier also talked to mr. flickinger about the possible change. among other things, mr. lanier told mr. flickinger that he did not want to continue working for plaintiff and that the crew complained about plaintiff “several times a week.” after speaking with his supervisors, mr. flickinger informed mr. lanier that, instead of being contractually obligated to work with plaintiff, timken was free to procure specific -7- construction-related maintenance services from crowder rather than plaintiff. in addition, mr. flickinger told mr. lanier that he would like the crew to stay at the asheboro plant regardless of whether they were employed by plaintiff, crowder, or some other company. after receiving this information, crowder provided salary and benefits information to mr. lanier, submitted a proposal under which crowder would perform work at timken’s asheboro plant to mr. flickinger, and completed the documentation required for crowder to become qualified to provide construction-related maintenance services at the asheboro plant. between july and october of 2010, the crew had frequent discussions concerning their dissatisfaction with plaintiff and the possibility that they might begin working for crowder instead. on 23 august 2010, mr. richardson received an email from caleb rice, one of plaintiff’s safety managers, in which mr. rice stated that: i just wanted to send you guys a note reflecting on my visit with steve lanier at timken asheboro last week. . . . i would regret not letting you know the concerns that steve has voiced to me, and knowing steve as a very honest and straightforward person, these are not idle threats. . . . steve is looking at other contactors to work for in the timken asheboro plant, and right now the only thing stalling the change is which company will offer the best pay and benefits. first of all, steve says that he -8- does not want to change companies, he feels that they have been through enough without having to go through another change, but the crew up there will not continue working with all of these issues. the following are some of the issues that he has had over the last two months. . . . . on the following day, mr. richardson traveled to the asheboro plant and met with mr. lanier, mr. flickinger, and the other members of the crew for the purpose of discussing issues that were of concern to the crew. however, the crew continued to be dissatisfied with their status as employees of plaintiff. on 27 september 2010, the members of the crew met with tracy moore to discuss working for crowder. although the benefits offered by crowder were not as favorable as those already provided by plaintiff, the entire crew decided to quit working for plaintiff and to go to work for crowder. as a result, on 7 october 2010, the crew traveled to crowder’s spartanburg, south carolina, office, where they completed job applications and were hired to work for crowder beginning on 18 october 2010. the crew was involved in moving a very large and complex machine during the following week. on 14 october 2010, which was a thursday, they worked three hours overtime in order to make sure that the machine move had been sufficiently completed that a regular timken employee or contractor could finish the -9- job without a loss of production capability if something prevented the crew from returning on monday as crowder employees. after finishing work on 14 october 2010, mr. lanier called mr. richardson and informed him that he, mr. mcdaniel, mr. turner, and mr. moore were resigning. on the following monday, 18 october 2010, mr. lanier and the other crew members returned to work at the asheboro plant as crowder employees. b. procedural history on 3 november 2010, plaintiff filed a complaint in which it sought damages from both defendants based on claims sounding in tortious interference with contractual relations, unfair or deceptive trade practices, and civil conspiracy and an additional claim against mr. lanier for breach of fiduciary duty. in addition, plaintiff sought the issuance of a permanent injunction barring crowder from providing construction-related maintenance services at the asheboro plant. on 3 january 2011, defendants filed separate answers in which they denied the material allegations of plaintiff’s complaint; asserted various affirmative defenses; sought dismissal of plaintiff’s complaint pursuant to n.c. gen. stat. § 1a-1, rule 12(b)(6); and requested an award of attorneys’ fees. on 20 april 2011, judge richard d. boner entered an order denying defendants’ dismissal motions and allowing plaintiff’s request to amend its complaint. -10- on 26 april 2011, plaintiff filed an amended complaint in which it asserted the same claims that had been asserted in its original complaint. in essence, plaintiff alleged that defendants had “knowingly conspired” to “implement a predatory scheme” by which the crew would resign “en masse” in “the middle of a critical machine move” on 14 october 2010 and that, given that set of circumstances, mr. flickinger “had no choice” but to use mr. lanier’s crew, in their capacity as crowder employees, for needed construction-related maintenance services. on 1 june 2011, defendants filed answers in which they denied the material allegations of the amended complaint, asserted various affirmative defenses, sought dismissal of plaintiff’s claims for failure to state a claim for which relief could be granted, and requested an award of attorneys’ fees. on 2 september 2011, defendants filed motions seeking the entry of summary judgment in their favor with respect to all of plaintiff’s claims. the trial court conducted a hearing for the purpose of addressing the issues raised by defendants’ summary judgment motions on 14 september 2011. on 2 november 2011, the trial court entered summary judgment orders in favor of defendants with respect to all of the claims that had been asserted in the amended complaint. plaintiff noted a timely appeal to this court from the trial court’s orders. -11- ii. legal analysis a. standard of review an award of summary judgment is appropriate “if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that any party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” n.c. gen. stat. § 1a-1, rule 56(c). “a party moving for summary judgment may prevail if it meets the burden (1) of proving an essential element of the opposing party’s claim is nonexistent, or (2) of showing through discovery that the opposing party cannot produce evidence to support an essential element of his or her claim.” lowe v. bradford, 305 n.c. 366, 369, 289 s.e.2d 363, 366 (1982) (citations omitted). “the party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.” liberty mut. ins. co. v. pennington, 356 n.c. 571, 579, 573 s.e.2d 118, 124 (2002) (citing dewitt v. eveready battery co., 355 n.c. 672, 681, 565 s.e.2d 140, 146 (2002)). however, “[o]nce the party seeking summary judgment makes the required showing, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to produce a forecast of evidence demonstrating specific facts, as opposed to allegations, showing that he can at least establish a prima facie case at trial.” gaunt v. pittaway, 139 -12- n.c. app. 778, 784-85, 534 s.e.2d 660, 664, disc. review denied, 353 n.c. 262, 546 s.e.2d 401 (2000), cert. denied, 353 n.c. 371, 547 s.e.2d 810, cert. denied, 534 u.s. 950, 122 s. ct. 345, 151 l. ed. 2d 261 (2001). “a genuine issue of material fact arises when ‘the facts alleged . . . are of such nature as to affect the result of the action.’” n.c. farm bureau mut. ins. co. v. sadler, 365 n.c. 179, 182, 711 s.e.2d 114, 116 (2011) (quoting kessing v. mortgage corp., 278 n.c. 523, 534, 180 s.e.2d 823, 830 (1971) (citation and quotation marks omitted)). “on a motion for summary judgment the court may consider evidence consisting of affidavits, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions, documentary materials, facts which are subject to judicial notice, and any other materials which would be admissible in evidence at trial.” huss v. huss, 31 n.c. app. 463, 466, 230 s.e.2d 159, 161-62 (1976) (citations omitted). “‘when considering a motion for summary judgment, the trial judge must view the presented evidence in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party.’” in re will of jones, 362 n.c. 569, 573, 669 s.e.2d 572, 576 (2008) (quoting dalton v. camp, 353 n.c. 647, 651, 548 s.e.2d 704, 707 (2001)). the “standard of review on appeal from summary judgment is whether there is any genuine issue of material fact and whether -13- the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” bruce-terminix co. v. zurich ins. co., 130 n.c. app. 729, 733, 504 s.e.2d 574, 577 (1998), mod. on other grounds, harleysville mut. ins. co. v. buzz off insect shield, l.l.c., 364 n.c. 1, 7, 692 s.e.2d 605, 611 (2010). a trial court’s decision to grant a summary judgment motion is reviewed on a de novo basis. va. elec. & power co. v. tillett, 80 n.c. app. 383, 385, 343 s.e.2d 188, 191, cert. denied, 317 n.c. 715, 347 s.e.2d 457 (1986). we will now utilize this standard of review for the purpose of analyzing the appropriateness of the trial court’s decision to grant summary judgment in favor of defendants. b. breach of fiduciary duty in its first challenge to the trial court’s order, plaintiff contends that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of mr. lanier with respect to plaintiff’s breach of fiduciary duty claim. in support of this argument, plaintiff asserts that the record discloses the existence of genuine issues of material fact regarding the extent to which mr. lanier owed a fiduciary duty to plaintiff and whether he breached that duty. plaintiff’s argument lacks merit.2 2although plaintiff makes much of allegedly unsupported “findings” of undisputed fact in the trial court’s order, we need not address its specific complaints about these “findings” -14- “for a breach of fiduciary duty to exist, there must first be a fiduciary relationship between the parties. such a relationship has been broadly defined by this court as one in which ‘there has been a special confidence reposed in one who in equity and good conscience is bound to act in good faith and with due regard to the interests of the one reposing confidence . . . and in which there is confidence reposed on one side, and resulting domination and influence on the other.’” dalton, 353 n.c. at 651, 548 s.e.2d at 707-08 (citing curl v. key, 311 n.c. 259, 264, 316 s.e.2d 272, 275 (1984), and quoting abbitt v. gregory, 201 n.c. 577, 598, 160 s.e. 896, 906 (1931)). “‘[i]n north carolina . . . there are two types of fiduciary relationships: (1) those that arise from legal relations such as attorney and client, broker and client . . . partners, principal and agent, trustee and cestui que trust, and (2) those that exist as a fact, in which there is confidence reposed on one side, and the resulting superiority and influence on the other.’” ellison v. alexander, 207 n.c. app 401, 408, 700 s.e.2d 102, 108 (2010) (quoting s.n.r. mgmt. corp. v. danube partners 141, llc, 189 n.c. app. 601, 613, 659 s.e.2d 442, 451 (2008) (internal citation omitted). given that we have been able, based on our own review of the record, to determine what the undisputed record evidence tends to show. -15- business partners, for example, are each other’s fiduciaries as a matter of law. in less clearly defined situations the question whether a fiduciary relationship exists is more open and depends ultimately on the circumstances. courts have historically declined to offer a rigid definition of a fiduciary relationship in order to allow imposition where justified. thus, the relationship can arise in a variety of circumstances . . . and may stem from varied and unpredictable factors. fiduciary duties of hajmm co. v. house of raeford farms, 328 n.c. 578, 588, 403 s.e.2d 483, 489 (1991) (citing casey v. grantham, 239 n.c. 121, 124-25, 79 s.e.2d 735, 738 (1954) (other citation omitted). the undisputed evidence tends to show that mr. lanier was the foreman of a crew that consisted of four men, including himself; that his job duties were confined to performing various tasks related to the provision of construction-related maintenance services; and that his employment was terminable at will by plaintiff. under that set of circumstances, we have no difficulty in concluding that mr. lanier did not occupy the type of fiduciary relationship with plaintiff that arises by operation of law, such as that inherent in an attorney-client relationship. as a result, the only way in which a fiduciary relationship between plaintiff and mr. lanier could have existed would be if plaintiff reposed trust and confidence in mr. lanier, resulting in a situation in which mr. lanier exercised “superiority and influence” over plaintiff. -16- although our appellate jurisprudence does not precisely define when a fiduciary relationship of this second type does or does not exist, “the broad parameters accorded the term have been specifically limited in the context of employment situations. under the general rule, ‘the relation of employer and employee is not one of those regarded as confidential.’” dalton, 353 n.c. at 651, 548 s.e.2d at 708 (quoting king v. r.r., 157 n.c. 44, 62-63, 72 s.e. 801, 808 (1911) (other citation omitted). as a result, in the absence of some unusual set of facts that would suffice to differentiate the relationship between plaintiff and mr. lanier from other employer-employee relationships, mr. lanier did not have a fiduciary relationship with plaintiff. according to the record, plaintiff’s corporate parent has over 7,000 employees and an annual income of approximately $300,000,000.00 to $500,000,000.00, of which plaintiff’s work at timken’s asheboro plant generated approximately $2,000,000.00, or .04 percent to .06 percent. of these 7,000 or so employees, only five were working at the asheboro plant, which plaintiff characterizes as a “remote” company site. as we have already noted, mr. lanier was an hourly, at-will employee charged with supervising a four-person crew. the record contains no evidence tending to show that mr. lanier played any role within -17- plaintiff’s organization except for that of a foreman overseeing a crew performing construction-related maintenance services. in light of that set of facts, we conclude that any confidence that plaintiff reposed in mr. lanier consisted of nothing more than relying on him to competently perform his assigned duties. simply put, given that the record demonstrates that mr. lanier was a relatively small cog in a very large operation, we have no hesitation about concluding that mr. lanier exercised little or no control over plaintiff’s overall operations and that mr. lanier did not owe any fiduciary duties to plaintiff. in attempting to persuade us to reach a contrary conclusion, plaintiff stresses the degree of responsibility and authority assigned to a foreman such as mr. lanier and argues that he had considerable responsibility for, and authority over, the other crew members. however, the fact that mr. lanier had responsibility for ensuring the proper performance of construction-related maintenance tasks assigned to his crew by mr. flickinger simply does not make him plaintiff’s fiduciary. as the supreme court observed in dalton: . . . [t]he managerial duties of camp were such that a certain level of confidence was reposed in him by dalton; and (2) as a confidant of his employer, camp was therefore bound to act in good faith and with due regard to the interests of dalton. in our view, such circumstances, as shown here, merely serve to define the nature of -18- all virtually employer-employee relationships; without more, they are inadequate to establish camp’s obligations as fiduciary in nature. no evidence suggests that his position in the workplace resulted in “domination and influence on the other [dalton],” an essential component of any fiduciary relationship. camp was hired as an at-will employee to manage the production of a publication. . . . [h]is responsibilities were not unlike those of employees in other businesses and can hardly be construed as uniquely positioning him to exercise dominion over dalton. dalton at 651-52, 548 s.e.2d at 708 (quoting abbitt, 201 n.c. at 598, 160 s.e. at 906). thus, for essentially the same reasons that underlie the supreme court’s decision in dalton, we conclude that mr. lanier’s status as the foreman of a four- person crew did not “uniquely position” him to exercise dominion over plaintiff. we have carefully considered plaintiff’s remaining arguments in support of its claim that mr. lanier breached his fiduciary duty owed to plaintiff, and conclude that they lack merit as well. for example, plaintiff contends that there are disputed issues of fact regarding the scope of mr. lanier’s responsibilities and authority given plaintiff’s contention that mr. lanier “participated in any discussions [with] plaintiff’s officers concerning management level decisions or operations of the company concerning cash flow, lines of credit, issuance of stock or debt and the like.” however, the only evidentiary -19- support that plaintiff has offered for this argument is the fact that mr. lanier had supervisory responsibility for a four-person crew and that he reported to mr. richardson, one of plaintiff’s managers. the undisputed record evidence shows that mr. lanier only interacted with mr. richardson concerning matters affecting his four-person crew; nothing in the record suggests that mr. lanier was ever involved in making any “management level decisions” as that term is ordinarily understood. similarly, plaintiff asserts that issues of fact regarding the extent to which mr. lanier owed a fiduciary duty to plaintiff arise from language in the msa spelling out plaintiff’s obligation to employ on-site supervisory personnel. however, the relevant language from the msa, which has no binding effect unless timken actually contracted with plaintiff to perform specific work at the asheboro plant, provides no additional basis for concluding that mr. lanier had a fiduciary relationship with plaintiff. moreover, plaintiff argues that the fact that mr. lanier was an hourly at-will employee and had not been asked to sign a non- competition agreement or similar documents is “immaterial to whether [plaintiff] reposed trust and confidence in [mr.] lanier resulting in [his] domination and influence on [plaintiff] at the timken asheboro plant site.” in view of the fact that the presence or absence of such agreements did shed light on the -20- nature of the relationship between plaintiff and mr. lanier, we believe that the trial court properly considered these factors in determining whether to grant summary judgment in favor of mr. lanier. as a result, none of plaintiff’s attempts to persuade us that there were genuine issues of material fact concerning the extent, if any, to which mr. lanier owed a fiduciary duty to plaintiff have any merit. similarly, we are unable to agree with plaintiff’s contention that the supreme court’s decision in sara lee corp. v. carter, 351 n.c. 27, 519 s.e.2d 308, rehearing denied, 351 n.c. 191, 541 s.e.2d 716 (1999), supports its contention that mr. lanier breached a fiduciary duty that he owed plaintiff. in sara lee, the defendant’s job description required him to provide the plaintiff “‘with the best possible pricing, availability, and support of hardware and services.’” in violation of this obligation, the defendant started his own company and “engaged in self-dealing by supplying sara lee with computer parts and services at allegedly excessive cost while concealing his interest in these businesses.” sara lee, 351 n.c. at 29, 519 s.e.2d at 309. on these facts, we upheld the trial court’s conclusion “that defendant owed a fiduciary duty to sara lee with respect to his role in recommending the purchase and ordering of computer parts and related services for -21- sara lee and that defendant breached that fiduciary duty[.]” sara lee at 30, 519 s.e.2d at 310. however, the alleged breach of fiduciary duty at issue in sara lee is very different from the alleged breach of fiduciary duty at issue here. according to plaintiff: the record evidence establishing that the self-dealing [mr.] lanier was a fiduciary of [plaintiff] is even stronger than that of the employee in sara lee. [plaintiff] entrusted and authorized its site manager [mr.] lanier to interact with its valued customer timken and to manage and supervise the other [plaintiff] employees at the site. [mr.] lanier maintained and repaired unique machinery for [plaintiff’s] customer timken. for [plaintiff’s] benefit he was supposed to maintain a strong relationship with [mr.] flickinger and provide other support as needed. . . . instead, [mr.] lanier acted to benefit himself to the strong detriment of his employer, [plaintiff]. however, the record contains no evidence that mr. lanier failed to “manage and supervise the other [plaintiff] employees at the site,” to “maintain a strong relationship with [mr.] flickinger,” to perform any other duty arising from his job description, or to refrain from engaging in self-dealing. on the contrary, the sole basis for plaintiff’s claim that mr. lanier engaged in “self-dealing” and acted “to benefit himself to the strong detriment of his employer” is the fact that mr. lanier resigned from his employment with plaintiff in order to -22- work for crowder because he “was clearly not happy working for [plaintiff]” and saw a “switch to crowder as being in his long- term best interests from a job satisfaction perspective.” (pb29) however, the fact that an at-will employee stops working for one employer, as the result of personal dissatisfaction with his existing position, and goes to work for another, who then takes over work that had previously been performed by the employee’s original employer, is not consistent with any recognized definition of “self-dealing,” see black’s law dictionary 1390 (8th ed. 2004) (defining self-dealing as “[p]articipation in a transaction that benefits oneself instead of another who is owed a fiduciary duty”), and does not bear any significant resemblance to the facts at issue in sara lee. in addition, plaintiff points out that the supreme court stated in dalton that the defendant, although not a fiduciary, was “bound to act in good faith and with due regard to the interests of” his employer. similarly, plaintiff argues that it “placed its trust and confidence in [mr.] lanier and that [he] used that trust, confidence and resulting power to dominate [plaintiff] and [plaintiff’s] other employees and, surreptitiously, from the inside, stole away the very business he was supposed to service and safeguard for [plaintiff].” however, the record contains no evidence tending to show that -23- mr. lanier had any responsibility, beyond the adequate performance of his job duties, for safeguarding timken’s decision to contract with plaintiff, instead of some other entity, for the provision of construction-related maintenance services at the asheboro plant. as a result, we do not believe that plaintiff’s argument in reliance upon dalton has any merit. we have carefully examined plaintiff’s factual contentions regarding the circumstances surrounding the resignation of mr. lanier and his co-workers from their employment with plaintiff and timken’s decision to transfer construction maintenance service work from plaintiff to crowder and have concluded that these contentions lack adequate record support. for example, plaintiff contends that mr. lanier “leveraged the trust and confidence reposed in him by [plaintiff] to pressure both [plaintiff’s] other employees and [mr.] flickinger into submitting to a conspiracy with crowder to replace [plaintiff] with crowder at the timken asheboro plant site.” in addition, plaintiff repeatedly asserts that mr. lanier “pressured” his co- workers and mr. flickinger to work with crowder instead of plaintiff and contends that, in order to “achieve his self- dealing goal, [mr.] lanier directed the crew to . . . resign en masse from [plaintiff] in the middle of a critical machine move.” finally, plaintiff contends that mr. lanier “filtered and provided the information that he thought would best advance his self-dealing conspiracy with crowder to steal the timken -24- business.” after thoroughly reviewing the evidentiary materials that were submitted for the trial court’s consideration, we find no evidence that mr. lanier “pressured” his crew to resign their employment with plaintiff or to begin working for crowder or that plaintiff “filtered” the information that they received prior to deciding to change employers. as we have already noted, each crew member testified that, even before learning of a possible position at crowder, they were planning to leave plaintiff’s employment. none of the crew members testified that mr. lanier “pressured” them into resigning their employment with plaintiff; in fact, the record is completely devoid of any evidence that mr. lanier suggested that the members of the crew should work for crowder rather than plaintiff. similarly, there is no evidence that mr. lanier concealed or “filtered” information in order to “pressure” his crew into leaving plaintiff’s employment. although the record does reflect that tracy moore sent copies of crowder’s benefits package to mr. lanier for delivery to the members of the crew and subsequently met with the crew to answer any questions they might have, nothing in the record reflects that mr. lanier did anything to -25- put pressure on his fellow crew members to leave their employment with plaintiff and to begin working with crowder. similarly, we find no indication that mr. lanier “pressured” mr. flickinger into using crowder rather than plaintiff for the purpose of providing construction-related maintenance services at the asheboro plant. mr. flickinger testified that he had worked with mr. lanier for over ten years, that “[mr. lanier’s] work is always top-notch,” and that, “[p]ersonally[,] i think he’s [] very honest[.]” during the four months that mr. lanier worked for plaintiff at timken’s asheboro plant, he and his crew did a good job and were “very conscientious” about safety regulations. after the crew began to have problems with plaintiff, mr. flickinger consulted with timken’s management about changing construction-related maintenance providers and learned that he had no contractual obligation to continue using plaintiff’s services. when mr. lanier spoke with mr. flickinger about the possibility that crowder would assume responsibility for performing construction- related maintenance work at the asheboro plant, mr. flickinger indicated that he was open to a proposal from crowder. in fact, mr. flickinger testified that he intended to continue working with mr. lanier’s crew regardless of whether they were employed by plaintiff, crowder, or some other company. simply put, -26- nothing in the present record in any way tends to show that mr. flickinger’s preference for working with mr. lanier’s crew had any source other than his satisfaction with the quality of their work. in addition, although plaintiff argues that the crew timed its resignation from plaintiff’s employment in such a way as to force mr. flickinger’s hand “by scheduling the . . . crew’s en masse resignation in the middle of a planned critical machine move,” the record simply does not support this assertion. instead, the undisputed evidence in the record indicates that mr. lanier’s crew worked several hours overtime on 14 october 2010 for the sole purpose of preventing any production delays in the event that the crew was unable to return to the asheboro plant on the following monday as employees of crowder. in essence, mr. flickinger testified that, when mr. lanier left on 14 october 2010, the work being done on the machine had reached “a point it would be operational so if no one was there monday . . . we could continue operations;” that the crew “finished the work that the mechanical contractor would have needed to that day, so if no one showed up monday, we could have continued to work with our associates and made product;” and that, when the members of the crew resigned from plaintiff’s employment, their part in the machine move was essentially “complete.” similarly, -27- mr. lanier testified that the crew worked on 14 october 2010 in order to “get that machine back where somebody could finish it if something happened.” as a result, we conclude that there is no record support for plaintiff’s contention that mr. flickinger was forced to stop using plaintiff for the provision of construction maintenance services based upon pressure from mr. lanier, the timing of the crew’s resignation, or any other similar factor.3 plaintiff also asserts that mr. lanier acted “secretly” and that he “secretly recruited the entire work force and betrayed [plaintiff] in persuading [mr.] flickinger to switch to the company that best suited him, to the detriment of [plaintiff].” a careful examination of the record reveals no indication that mr. lanier or his crew made any effort to hide their dissatisfaction with plaintiff. mr. lanier discussed the crew’s complaints with mr. flickinger, who testified that, every time mr. richardson visited the plant, “[he] would tell him, the guys aren’t happy, you need to try to help[.]” in addition, the record reflects that mr. rice met with mr. lanier in mid-august 2010 and, at mr. lanier’s request, informed plaintiff of the crew’s dissatisfaction. on 23 august 2010, mr. rice sent mr. richardson an email that specifically informed him that mr. 3mr. richardson testified that he had no personal knowledge of the status of the machine move as of 14 october 2010. -28- lanier was “looking at other contactors to work for in the timken asheboro plant, and right now the only thing stalling the change is which company will offer the best pay and benefits.” the fact that mr. richardson claims not to have noticed this portion of the email does not in any way detract from the fact that it was sent. as a result, the record contains no indication that mr. lanier acted secretly. in addition, such an allegation, even if proven, would not necessarily constitute evidence of wrongdoing. plaintiff has not cited any authority tending to suggest that mr. lanier had an obligation to keep plaintiff apprised of his desire to quit, his discussions with co-workers about changing jobs, or his negotiations with crowder. “in north carolina, ‘in the absence of an employment contract for a definite period, both employer and employee are generally free to terminate their association at any time and without any reason.’” elliott v. enka-candler fire and rescue, __ n.c. app __, __, 713 s.e.2d 132, 135 (2011) (quoting salt v. applied analytical, inc., 104 n.c. app. 652, 655, 412 s.e.2d 97, 99 (1991), cert. denied, 331 n.c. 119, 415 s.e.2d 200 (1992)) (other citations omitted). as the supreme court has recognized, “[t]o restrict an employer’s right to entice employees, bound only by terminable at will contracts, from their positions with a competitor or to restrict where -29- those employees may be put to work once they accept new employment savors strongly of oppression.” peoples security life ins. co. v. hooks, 322 n.c. 216, 222-23, 367 s.e.2d 647, 651, rehearing denied, 322 n.c. 486, 370 s.e.2d 227 (1988) (citation omitted). as a result, for all of these reasons, we conclude that the trial court did not err by granting summary judgment in favor of mr. lanier with respect to plaintiff’s breach of fiduciary duty claim. c. tortious interference with contract secondly, plaintiff argues that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of defendants with respect to plaintiff’s tortious interference with contract claim. in support of this contention, plaintiff contends that the record reflects the existence of a genuine issue of fact concerning the extent to which “defendants conspired to pressure [mr.] flickinger not to perform the msa with austin and to hire crowder instead” and to which “defendants acted without justification.” once again, we conclude that plaintiff’s arguments lack merit. “the tort of interference with contract has five elements: (1) a valid contract between the plaintiff and a third person which confers upon the plaintiff a contractual right against a third person; (2) the defendant knows of the contract; (3) the -30- defendant intentionally induces the third person not to perform the contract; (4) and in doing so acts without justification; (5) resulting in actual damage to the plaintiff.” united laboratories, inc. v. kuykendall, 322 n.c. 643, 661, 370 s.e.2d 375, 387 (1988) (citing childress v. abeles, 240 n.c. 667, 674 84 s.e. 2d 176, 182-83 (1954)). a careful study of the record compels the conclusion that plaintiff has failed to forecast evidence tending to show the existence of the first element required to establish a tortious interference with contract claim. as we have already noted, the msa sets out the terms and conditions under which plaintiff and timken agreed to do business. “it is common practice for companies and contractors to enter into master service agreements, the specific terms of which govern future work performed by the contractor pursuant to individual work orders or authorizations.” john e. graham & sons v. brewer (in re john e. graham & sons), 210 f.3d 333, 341, rehearing denied, 2000 u.s. app. lexis 15071 (5th cir. la. may 22, 2000). “typically, they first sign a ‘blanket contract’ that may remain in place for an extended period of time. later, they issue work orders for the performance of specific work, which usually incorporate[] the terms of the blanket contract.” grand isle shipyard inc. v. seacor marine, llc, 589 f.3d 778, -31- 787 n.6 (5th cir. la. 2009), cert. denied, __ u.s. __, 130 s. ct. 3386, 177 l. ed. 2d 302 (2010). “a master service agreement contemplates as yet unspecified and wholly contingent performance in the future. the agreement standing alone obligates neither party to perform any services. the issuance of a specific work order triggers the obligation to perform.” burnham v. sun oil co., 618 f. supp. 782, 785-86 (w.d. la. 1985). consistently with the pattern outlined above, the msa defines timken as the “buyer” and plaintiff (standing in sanders brothers’ shoes) as the “contractor,” provides for a seven year term, and defines a “purchase order” as the “document or electronic notification through which service(s) and/or merchandise shall be requested by buyer.” the msa “shall be incorporated into and made a part of each buyer’s purchase order issued to contractor, whether or not expressly incorporated by reference in the purchase order,” and, “together with . . . purchase order(s) . . . and other documents specifically incorporated by reference . . . [,] comprise the entire agreement between the parties.” the msa does not include an agreement by timken or plaintiff to enter into any particular number of contracts for the provision of construction-related maintenance services; instead, the msa expressly states that -32- “contractor acknowledges that this agreement is not a commitment by buyer to purchase any service(s) and/or merchandise from contractor on an exclusive basis or otherwise.” as a result, we conclude that the msa does not obligate timken to enter into any purchase orders with plaintiff, a fact which requires a finding that timken’s decision to award specific construction-related maintenance service contracts to crowder did not breach the msa. in seeking to persuade us that the record did, in fact, reflect the existence of a genuine issue of material fact with respect to this issue, plaintiff relies solely on mr. richardson’s testimony concerning the existence of “verbal agreements” that were allegedly entered into outside the scope of the msa. the principal problem with this argument is that the msa contains a merger clause which clearly provides that the msa, taken in conjunction with other pertinent written documents, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties. in addition, plaintiff directs our attention to mr. richardson’s belief that the provision to the effect that the msa “is not a commitment by buyer to purchase any service(s) and/or merchandise from contractor on an exclusive basis or otherwise” should be understood to mean that timken was obligated to contract with plaintiff for the provision of construction- related maintenance services while retaining the ability to -33- employ specialty contractors as necessary. this “interpretation” is, however, contrary to the literal language of the relevant msa provision, so we decline to adopt it. in addition, plaintiff disputes defendants’ contention that the msa does not require timken to obtain construction-related maintenance services exclusively from plaintiff. this aspect of plaintiff’s argument rests upon article 36 of the msa, which states that “[t]he contractor agrees to supply the listed services and/or merchandise to all buyers, and buyer’s subsidiaries’ facilities, including but not limited to” timken bearing and alloy steel plants located in certain specified states. this provision, which simply specifies the geographical scope of the agreement, does not operate to override the remainder of the agreement, which clearly requires separate purchase orders in the event that timken wished plaintiff to perform any specific service. moreover, although article 36 obligates plaintiff to supply construction-related maintenance services to a list of locations, it does not obligate timken to contract for these services at any of those locations. thus, this aspect of plaintiff’s argument fails as well. as a result, in light of our review of the msa, we conclude that (1) the msa does not require timken to contract with plaintiff for provision of construction maintenance services, -34- either at its asheboro plant or elsewhere; (2) the msa does not confer any specific contractual rights upon plaintiff until timken and plaintiff executed a purchase order which required plaintiff to provide specific construction maintenance services;4 and (3), as mr. richardson conceded during his deposition, timken did not breach the msa by beginning to use crowder, rather than plaintiff, to perform construction maintenance services at timken’s asheboro plant. as a result, given that the msa conferred no contractual rights on plaintiff until the execution of a specific purchase order and given that plaintiff failed to adduce any evidence that timken failed to perform any of its obligations under the msa, we conclude that plaintiff failed to produce evidence that the msa “confers upon the plaintiff a contractual right against a third person.” united laboratories, 322 n.c. at 661, 370 s.e.2d at 387. thus, the trial court did not err by granting summary judgment in favor of defendants with respect to plaintiff’s tortious interference with contract claim. d. unfair or deceptive trade practices thirdly, plaintiff argues that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of defendants with respect to 4plaintiff does not assert that timken violated any specific purchase order as a result of defendants’ conduct. instead, plaintiff’s tortious interference claim relies solely on alleged violations of the msa. -35- its unfair or deceptive trade practices claim. in support of this contention, plaintiff argues that defendants “interrupted the commercial relationship between austin and timken,” that “their actions of hiring away the entire work force and inducing non-performance of the austin/timken msa by timken” constituted unfair and deceptive trade practices, and that mr. lanier “surreptitiously raided the entire austin workforce to his and crowder’s benefit and to the clear detriment of austin.” we do not find plaintiff’s arguments persuasive. “the extent of trade practices deemed as unfair and deceptive is summarized in [n.c. gen. stat.] § 75-1.1(a) (‘the act’), which . . . was intended to benefit consumers[.] . . . [t]he act does not normally extend to run-of-the-mill employment disputes[, unless] . . . an employee’s conduct: (1) involved egregious activities outside the scope of his assigned employment duties, and (2) otherwise qualified as unfair or deceptive practices that were in or affecting commerce.” dalton, 353 n.c. at 655-56, 548 s.e.2d at 710-11 (citing pearce v. american defender life ins. co., 316 n.c. 461, 469, 343 s.e.2d 174, 179 (1986), hajmm co., 328 n.c. at 593, 403 s.e.2d at 492, and sara lee, 351 n.c. at 34, 519 s.e.2d at 312). for example, in dalton, 353 n.c. at 658, 548 s.e.2d at 712, in which the defendant formed a company for the purpose of competing with his employer before resigning and then obtaining the contract previously held by his employer, the supreme court held: -36- that [the defendant] failed to inform his employer of the ongoing negotiations and resigned after signing the kfi deal may be an unfortunate circumstance; however, in our view, such business-related conduct, without more, is neither unlawful in itself. . . . nor aggravating or egregious enough to overcome presumption against unfair and deceptive practices claims as between employers and employees. longstanding the similarly, in this case, the undisputed evidence showed that (1) by july or august, 2010, before they were provided with information concerning crowder, mr. lanier and the crew working with him had each made the independent decision to look for a new employer; (2) mr. lanier discussed the crew’s complaints with mr. flickinger and mr. richardson; (3) at mr. lanier’s request, mr. rice informed mr. richardson that the crew was looking for a company to replace plaintiff at timken’s asheboro plant; and (4) the crew decided to work for crowder despite a reduction in the level of their employer-provided benefits. as a result, we conclude that the record fails to support plaintiff’s assertion that defendants “surreptitiously raided” plaintiff’s workforce and that neither the decision by mr. lanier and his crew members to become crowder employees nor the manner in which crowder obtained the right to perform construction-related maintenance work previously performed by plaintiff supported a finding of liability under n.c. gen. stat. -37- § 75-1.1. in urging us to reach a contrary result, plaintiff cites sunbelt rentals, inc. v. head & engquist equip., l.l.c., 174 n.c. app. 49, 620 s.e.2d 222 (2005), disc. review dismissed, 360 n.c. 296, 629 s.e.2d 289 (2006). according to plaintiff, sunbelt “expressly prohibits as an unfair trade practice the surreptitious and intentional use of employees to solicit other employees while both the soliciting and solicited employees are still employed by the same company.” aside from the fact that we do not read sunbelt as enunciating a per se rule of the nature described by plaintiff and the fact that sunbelt is readily distinguishable from this case on a factual basis, the record does not contain any evidence tending to show that defendants engaged in “the surreptitious and intentional use of employees to solicit other employees.” in sunbelt, the president and other key executives of a corporation resigned in order to work for a competitor. subsequently, they secretly recruited more than seventy key managerial employees at various locations to join them. the result of this series of activities was that the plaintiff’s “branches were severely impacted, or ‘crippled,’ to the point [that the plaintiff’s] opportunity and ability to compete for -38- key employees on a level playing field was completely eliminated.” sunbelt, 174 n.c. app at 51, 60, 620 s.e.2d at 225, 230. in addition, the defendants misappropriated trade secrets by sharing certain confidential information with this competitor. on the other hand, in this case a four-man work crew, all of whom were at-will employees responsible for performing construction-related maintenance services, became dissatisfied with plaintiff and left to work for a different company. aside from the fact that the resignation of these four men from an organization employing over 7,000 employees differs dramatically from the situation at issue in sunbelt, the record does not establish that the events in question involved the disclosure of confidential information, had significant impact on plaintiff’s financial situation, or caused damage to plaintiff’s competitive position. thus, we do not believe that sunbelt has any significant bearing on the proper resolution of this case. in addition, plaintiff cites songwooyarn trading co. v. sox eleven, __ n.c. app __, 714 s.e.2d 162, disc. review denied, 365 n.c. 360, 718 s.e.2d 396 (2011), in support of its attempt to establish the validity of its unfair or deceptive trade practices claim. in songwooyarn, the defendant misappropriated funds belonging to his employer and secretly diverted monies -39- that were supposed to be paid to one of his employer’s corporate affiliates for his own use. on appeal, we upheld the trial court’s decision to direct a verdict in favor of the plaintiff with respect to its unfair and deceptive trade practices claim. songwooyarn is easily distinguished from the facts of the present case and does not control its outcome. although plaintiff’s unfair and deceptive trade practices claim rests on allegations that defendants “secretly pressured” plaintiff’s employees to change jobs, thereby “induc[ing]” timken to breach the msa, the record does not, as we have already demonstrated, support these assertions. as a result, none of the arguments upon which plaintiff relies in challenging the trial court’s decision to grant summary judgment in defendants’ favor with respect to plaintiff’s unfair and deceptive trade practices claim have merit. e. civil conspiracy and injunctive relief finally, plaintiff argues that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of defendants with respect to its civil conspiracy claim and its request for injunctive relief. plaintiff has not, however, advanced any specific arguments directed in opposition to the trial court’s rulings with respect to these claims. instead, plaintiff simply asserts that, “[f]or the reasons discussed” in addressing its other -40- challenges to the trial court’s rulings, the trial court erred by granting summary judgment with respect to plaintiff’s civil conspiracy claim and by denying plaintiff’s request for the issuance of a permanent injunction. having already considered and rejected these arguments, we necessarily conclude that the trial court did not err by granting summary judgment in defendants’ favor with respect to plaintiff’s civil conspiracy claim and rejecting its request for injunctive relief. iii. conclusion thus, for the reasons set forth above, we conclude that the trial court did not err by entering orders granting summary judgment in favor of defendants and denying plaintiff’s request for the issuance of a permanent injunction. as a result, the trial court’s orders should be, and hereby are, affirmed. affirmed. judges mcgee and steelman concur.
